Instructors and technologists alike abhor technology tools that feel shoehorned into a course, to be used more for the sake of being “21st century” than to improve student learning.

We’ll showcase examples from courses across the curriculum that engage students in writing for the web, socially annotating images, digitally archiving physical works and building interactive timelines.\r\n\r\nWe’ll also delve into the technical details used to make these projects happen.
