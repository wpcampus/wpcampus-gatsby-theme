And our planning methods became less effective. It&#8217;s time to try something new in how WPCampus organizes and fosters our community, its events, and its initiatives.</p>\n<h2>TL;DR</h2>\n<p>From now on, the WPCampus community will post all planning activity, announcements, requests for feedback, decisions, and anything else related to planning our organization&#8217;s growth to the new WPCampus Planning Blog.</p>\n<p>The WPCampus Slack #planning channel will continue to be our home for planning-related discussion. WPCampus members will use the #planning channel to share and discuss the Planning Blog. All requests for planning-related feedback will go through the Planning Blog. All public planning meetings that took place in the #planning channel have been canceled indefinitely.</p>\n<p>You can now <a href=\"http://eepurl.com/hppn0T\">subscribe</a> to Planning Blog email updates to stay informed of new posts.</p>\n<p>Please read the first Planning Blog post announcing our <a href=\"https://www.dev5290.wpcampus.org/community/planning/call-for-wpcampus-2021-organizers/\">Call for WPCampus 2021 organizers</a>. And be on the lookout for an upcoming survey looking for WPCampus 2021 feedback.</p>\n<p>Keep reading if you&#8217;re interested in the history of our planning methods, the lessons we learned, a deeper dive into how the new Planning Blog will work, and how to stay involved with planning our community.</p>\n<h2>The history of WPCampus planning</h2>\n<p>A vital component of our planning process has always been the <a href=\"https://wordcampus.slack.com/archives/C09KVRH28\">WPCampus Slack workspace #planning channel</a>. This channel has been home to all public community planning conversations.</p>\n<p>Public planning meetings take place directly within the #planning Slack channel. Depending on the time of year and how close we are to hosting a WPCampus event, planning meetings would take place weekly or bi-weekly. Any members interested in helping plan our community events and initiatives may join the meetings to provide feedback, suggest ideas, and participate in voting via emoji. </p>\n<p>WPCampus committees (like the planning committee for a specific conference) and other working groups tend to have private discussions but share their efforts and updates, and ask for feedback, via the #planning channel.</p>\n<p>At any time, the #planning channel is a great place to post questions and notes and discuss, develop, and foster ideas—allowing members to provide feedback at will.</p>\n<p>If the conversation there seems essential, organizers share in the #general Slack channel to broaden input. We post prominent announcements to the main WPCampus blog to expand information beyond our Slack audience.</p>\n<h2>Why our planning methods became less effective</h2>\n<p>Overall, our planning method worked pretty well for the first five years of our organization. But there were small issues that grew in prominence. It became clear we need to rethink how we plan and organize our community.</p>\n<h3>Not everyone could attend the planning meeting</h3>\n<p>When you only have one planning meeting a week, this restricts who can attend and participate. We enjoy the textual format of hosting meetings in Slack so that those who cannot participate can read the transcript later and provide feedback. But because our Slack plan is free (which means our messages aren&#8217;t indefinitely archived), meeting transcripts are eventually lost.</p>\n<h3>The need to hold meetings became sporadic and hard to manage</h3>\n<p>When we are planning an event, we hold a planning meeting each week. But throughout the rest of the year, there is no need to maintain a weekly meeting. So we started holding bi-weekly meetings. If we had nothing to discuss, we would cancel the meeting. Over time, meetings&#8217; sporadic and unpredictable nature became hard to manage for organizers and attendees, and attendance noticeably dropped.</p>\n<h3>Our planning notes aren&#8217;t centrally stored and easy to find</h3>\n<p>As an organization, we use Google Drive to store our organizational notes and information, including meeting minutes, agendas, etc. As part of Slack functionality, we try to &#8220;pin&#8221; and link these documents within related Slack channels. We also try to link these documents to related pages on our website. But we don&#8217;t have an organized, central place to help members find planning information and documentation.</p>\n<h3>You have to be fairly active in Slack to keep up</h3>\n<p>Our community has always been pretty Slack-active. It&#8217;s where we get things done. But not everyone can be tuned in to Slack all day, which means you might miss a vital planning tidbit from time to time.</p>\n<h2>How we&#8217;re going to plan our community from now on</h2>\n<p>So now that we&#8217;ve learned some lessons, it&#8217;s time to try something new. And with that, we introduce the first step forward: the <a href=\"http://www.dev5290.wpcampus.org/community/planning/\">WPCampus Planning Blog</a>.</p>\n<p>From now on, we will post all planning activity, announcements, requests for feedback, decisions, and anything else related to planning our organization&#8217;s growth to the WPCampus Planning Blog.</p>\n<h3>The Planning Blog will allow for:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Planning conversations and feedback to be more asynchronous\n<ul>\n<li>Discussions and updates will not depend on our Slack #planning channel or a planning meeting</li>\n<li>You can receive planning information and respond to calls for action or surveys in your own time</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Planning discussions to expand outside the WPCampus Slack workspace\n<ul>\n<li>You can <a href=\"http://eepurl.com/hppn0T\">subscribe to the WPCampus Planning Blog newsletter</a> and receive an automated email when a new blog post is published, which means you don&#8217;t have to be active in Slack to stay informed</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Our planning notes and documentation to be more accessible\n<ul>\n<li>Publishing on the website will allow the blog to be indexed and publically searched</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The Planning Blog posts will also:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Share updates related to planning our organization and community</li>\n<li>Ask for help planning events and initiatives</li>\n<li>Share &#8220;behind the scenes&#8221; updates about events and initiatives</li>\n<li>Publish surveys to gather feedback to help leadership make decisions</li>\n<li>Publish agendas and meeting minutes for WPCampus planning committees and working groups</li>\n<li>And more!</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Who will publish to the Planning Blog?</h3>\n<p>For now, only myself and WPCampus members in a leadership position will be allowed to post to the Planning Blog. For example, you might see posts from the chair of the new WPCampus 2021 organizing committee or from Dash or Trip, the co-chairs of the Diversity and Inclusion committee.</p>\n<h3>What this means for public planning meetings</h3>\n<p>For now, all public community planning meetings have been canceled indefinitely. The Planning Blog&#8217;s goal is to foster planning-related communication and feedback without the need for meetings. We will re-introduce meetings if deemed necessary. Working groups and committees will continue to meet.</p>\n<h3>What this means for the #planning channel</h3>\n<p>The #planning channel has always been and will continue to be an excellent place for planning-related discussion. Feel free to continue to use the channel to post any planning-related ideas and foster planning-related discussion. The WPCampus Slack #planning channel will also host comments and discussions related to the Planning Blog. </p>\n<p>In the next section, <a href=\"#interact\">How to interact with the Planning Blog</a>, I discuss how to use the #planning channel going forward.</p>\n<h2 id=\"interact\">How to interact with the Planning Blog</h2>\n<h3>How to ask questions, provide feedback, and comment on blog posts</h3>\n<p>To get the blog up and running quickly, I opted to forego comments. We all know managing comments can be quite tricky. </p>\n<p>Still, <b>feedback is the most important of the planning process</b>. I will solve this issue first. </p>\n<p>For now, we will discuss the planning blog posts within the WPCampus Slack #planning channel.</p>\n<h3>If a planning blog post asks for specific feedback</h3>\n<p>If a planning blog post asks for specific feedback, the blog post will include a survey form. This method allows WPCampus members to participate more efficiently and for WPCampus leadership to measure and analyze results. When a survey is closed, we will publish the results within the Planning Blog.</p>\n<h3>If a planning blog post requires a call for action</h3>\n<p>Often, our planning efforts require assistance. For example, organizers might be looking for conference assistance or need help with web content or development. If a blog post requires a call for action, the blog post will include further instructions.</p>\n<h2>In closing: Thank you!</h2>\n<p>Publishing the WPCampus Planning Blog is the first step towards what I hope will be lots of positive and constructive change for planning our community and events. Ongoing efforts will be needed to ensure we have well organized and discoverable planning information and frequent communication and transparent processes.</p>\n<p>WPCampus governance — of both the organization and community — is important to me. I know that it currently needs and will always need improvement. I hope these changes will help us improve our community together.</p>\n<p>Thank you to all who have been a part of our planning process. So many of you show up and put in the work. You give what you can, and I am so grateful for you.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s to the future of WPCampus, eduwapuu, Truck Sheep, and all of you who contribute and participate and make our community special.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"cbc27153-ee39-57cc-8b14-d98007120136","wordpress_id":263,"count":1,"name":"Planning","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/planning/"}]}}]},"allWordpressWpPlanning":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"ed29030f-e6ce-537e-a7e8-401cf7ff928f","wordpress_id":40964,"type":"planning","slug":"call-for-wpcampus-2021-organizers","path":"/community/planning/call-for-wpcampus-2021-organizers/","author":[{"id":"5b20c675-91a1-53fe-a06f-3328df4a586e","path":"bamadesigner","display_name":"Rachel Cherry","email":"rachel@wpcampus.org","twitter":"bamadesigner","website":"https://bamadesigner.com/","company":"WPCampus","company_position":"Director","bio":"I'm the Director/Founder of WPCampus and a freelance software engineer and accessibility/higher ed consultant.

Our tenth conference to be exact.</p>\n<p>And this year is obviously quite out of the ordinary. COVID-19 is still prevalent throughout much of our society. “When will it be safe to have an in-person event?” is still a big unanswered question. We usually hold the main WPCampus conference in mid-July. Will we be able to meet in-person this summer?</p>\n<h2>Looking back to WPCampus 2020</h2>\n<p>In looking back to last year’s event, I am so grateful to everyone who helped organize <a href=\"https://2020.dev5290.wpcampus.org/\">WPCampus 2020</a>. The introduction of COVID in early 2020 dealt a massive blow to in-person events and conferences throughout the year, including our own. Our community was so excited to head to Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana (scheduled for July 2020). But so much was out of our control.</p>\n<p>The 2020 organizing team gathered community feedback and managed a graceful pivot and <a href=\"https://www.dev5290.wpcampus.org/blog/2020/03/wpcampus-2020-to-go-online/\">WPCampus 2020 migrated from our usual in-person event</a> to a 100% online event. It was the right thing to do. Our members’ emotional and physical health will always be our primary concern. Thankfully, our community is no stranger to <a href=\"https://online.dev5290.wpcampus.org/\">online conferences</a> and assembled another successful gathering of the minds.</p>\n<p>Hosting a 100% online event also meant many who could not join us in-person (due to financial or other resource constraints) could participate more. Adding voices and increasing access is always a win.</p>\n<h2>Looking towards WPCampus 2021</h2>\n<p>So, where do we go from here?</p>\n<p>Well, it&#8217;s time to start thinking about what we want to do for WPCampus 2021. And with that, I’m <b>officially opening the planning season for WPCampus 2021</b> and putting out a call for organizers.</p>\n<p>Admittedly, we’re getting started a little later than usual, but life sometimes gets in the way. I don’t know about you, but between COVID and U.S. political turmoil, I didn’t have a lot of spare mental bandwidth in January.</p>\n<h2>A call for action: we need WPCampus 2021 organizers</h2>\n<p>The first step of planning a WPCampus conference is assembling the conference planning committee. The committee should consist of about 5-10 members, with room for more if needed.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in conference planning, helping plan WPCampus conferences are a great way to get started.</p>\n<p>I recommend you <a href=\"#roles\">read the descriptions for each role</a> and use the included form to submit your interest in being a part of the committee.</p>\n<p><a class=\"wpc-button wpc-button--primary wpc-button--expand wpc-button--center wpc-button--larger\" href=\"#submit\" aria-label=\"Submit interest in being on the WPCampus 2021 organizing committee\">Submit interest to be a WPCampus 2021 organizer</a></p>\n<h3>A new perk for being on the organizing committee</h3>\n<p>In exchange for helping plan WPCampus 2021, I’m excited to offer a new and hopefully intriguing perk: all committee members will gain early access to professional event management software that I am building with Sara Clark (we plan to license this software soon).</p>\n<p>WPCampus will use the &#8220;front-end&#8221; of the platform for the event, and the WPCampus 2021 conference organizers will have access to the &#8220;back-end&#8221; where all the planning fun takes place.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re an event planner or aspiring event planner, this is an opportunity to test-drive our new software for free in exchange for your help planning WPCampus 2021.</p>\n<h2 id=\"roles\">The WPCampus 2021 Committee roles</h2>\n<p>We’re looking for the following committee roles. This list might change or expand once a Committee Chair has been established. Feel free to send me a message in the <a href=\"https://www.dev5290.wpcampus.org/community/slack/\">WPCampus Slack workspace</a> if you have questions. Use the included form to submit your interest in being a committee member.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#rolechair\">Committee Chair</a> (1 person)</li>\n<li><a href=\"#rolepresenter\">Presenter Coordinators</a> (1-2 persons)</li>\n<li><a href=\"#rolesponsor\">Sponsor Coordinators</a> (1-2 persons)</li>\n<li><a href=\"#rolevolunteer\">Volunteer Coordinators</a> (1-2 persons)</li>\n<li><a href=\"#rolemarketing\">Marketing Coordinator</a> (1 person)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a class=\"wpc-button wpc-button--primary wpc-button--expand wpc-button--center wpc-button--larger\" href=\"#submit\" aria-label=\"Submit interest in being on the WPCampus 2021 organizing committee\">Submit interest to be a WPCampus 2021 organizer</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"rolechair\">The Committee Chair (1 person)</h3>\n<p>I have been the Conference Chair for most of our conferences (which is fine with me) but I would prefer to give up my role and allow someone else to take the lead. I love the idea of fresh ideas and energy, helping someone else, or helping to mentor someone who wants event planning experience.</p>\n<p>I will be on the committee and will be available for any guidance. You will have as much support as you want and need.</p>\n<h4>Responsibilities</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Organizes the larger vision for the event</li>\n<li>Organizes committee meetings and communication</li>\n<li>Manages the budget</li>\n<li>Generally makes sure things get done</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>General expectations and time requirements</h4>\n<p>The time involved varies from week to week. The committee should meet weekly, so that takes about an hour. You should expect to contribute another 1-2 hours a week depending on the timeline and how much work you delegate. Some weeks you may be in waiting mode. Some weeks may require sending a lot of emails and making a few phone calls.</p>\n<p>One of the first tasks you’ll need to coordinate is releasing a survey to our community to ask for feedback regarding COVID, dates for the event, and the number of days for the event. It’s also a great opportunity to ask for feedback regarding session formats, social opportunities, and other event-specific information.</p>\n<p>The Committee Chair should feel free to change up roles and responsibilities and move things around. The descriptions provided are simply in line with how we’ve planned past conferences. Also, feel free to add an “Assistant Chair” role to the committee.</p>\n<p>In relation to other conferences, WPCampus conferences are on the smaller side, which allows for a more relaxed and flexible environment. It’s a fun and rewarding opportunity for anyone interested in event planning. We do have some expectations and requirements to ensure we provide a high-quality event. But, in general, we are open to new ideas. We have a lot of experience to help with as much or as little guidance as you need.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rolepresenter\">Presenter Coordinators (1-2 persons)</h3>\n<p>Being a Presenter Coordinator is quite rewarding. You get to work directly with outstanding presenters to foster and present quality content for our entire community.</p>\n<h4>Responsibilities</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Coordinates the call for presenters</li>\n<li>Organizes the event program and works to make sure it is diverse of voice and topic</li>\n<li>Manage communication with presenters</li>\n<li>Makes sure presenters have everything they need</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>General expectations and time requirements</h4>\n<p>This role will be required to attend a weekly meeting. In addition, the time involved will vary with the timeline of the event. When the call for presenters is open, more work will be necessary. You will need to plan for extra time when the call for presenters has closed. You will have to review the proposals and create the program. Once that task is complete, the remainder of your workload will be to manage communication with presenters and work to ensure they have what they need to be successful.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rolesponsor\">Sponsor Coordinators (1-2 persons)</h3>\n<p>The WPCampus community has always been fortunate to work alongside an amazing group of organizations who have given us so much support over the years. Being a Sponsor Coordinator is a great opportunity to network with these organizations and help foster and promote our constructive relationship with vendors. Sponsor Coordinators also play a huge role in ensuring our event has the resources we need to host a great event.</p>\n<h4>Responsibilities</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Organize and manage sponsor perks</li>\n<li>Reach out to and recruit past and future sponsors</li>\n<li>Manage communication with sponsors</li>\n<li>Make sure sponsors have everything they need</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>General expectations and time requirements</h4>\n<p>This role will be required to attend a weekly meeting. In addition, I would plan for 1-2 hours a week. At the beginning of the planning period, this role will be more active to help recruit sponsors and make sure invoices are paid and sponsor information is retrieved. Closer to the event, this role will work to ensure any and all sponsor “perks” are delivered. Overall, this role will send a lot of emails to help manage communication with sponsors and ensure sponsors have everything they need to be successful.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rolevolunteer\">Volunteer Coordinators (1-2 persons)</h3>\n<p>If you have ever attended one of our events, you know how important volunteers are towards our success. Volunteers make sure presenters are ready, host online rooms, moderate Slack and online chat, and post announcements. Volunteers ensure our events run smoothly. The Volunteer Coordinator is a vital role. If you like logistics and coordination, this role is for you.</p>\n<h4>Responsibilities</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Recruit and organize volunteers for the event</li>\n<li>Organize the volunteer schedule for the event</li>\n<li>Manage communication with volunteers</li>\n<li>Make sure volunteers have everything they need</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>General expectations and time requirements</h4>\n<p>This role will be required to attend a weekly meeting. In addition, the time involved will vary with the timeline of the event. Your responsibilities will increase as the event draws near. This role will also be fairly active during the event to ensure volunteers are present and active. You will know exactly what to prepare for the event so if you make a little bit of progress each week, you should be able to spread out the workload throughout the planning period and keep your hours to a minimum.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rolemarketing\">Marketing Coordinator (1 person)</h3>\n<p>If you’re interested in marketing, then you know how important this role is to the team and to our organization. You will have a lot of support and flexibility to be creative and bring new ideas.</p>\n<h4>Responsibilities</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Plans, coordinates, and schedules emails, tweets, and other marketing for the event</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>General expectations and time requirements</h4>\n<p>This role will be required to attend a weekly meeting. In addition, the time involved will vary with the timeline of the event. There will be certain periods where we’ll need a big push of communication (e.g. when the call for presenters opens or closes, when registration opens, when we announce the program, right before the event), and other times when the need will be minimal. The more you can plan ahead, the more you will be able to spread out the work and keep your hours to a minimum.</p>\n<h2 id=\"submit\">Submit your interest to be a WPCampus 2021 organizer</h2>\n<p>Use the following form to submit your interest to be a WPCampus 2021 organizer. The submissions will be forward to me, WPCampus Director, and I will begin to assemble what will no doubt be an amazing team.</p>\n<p>As always, feel free to send me a message in the WPCampus Slack workspace or send me an email at rachel[at]dev5290.wpcampus.org if you have any questions about the committee.</p>\n"}}]},"allWordpressWpPodcast":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"12c9b68d-abee-5bac-b425-c7aec2a30b6d","wordpress_id":7252,"type":"podcast","slug":"wpcampus-2016-retrospective","path":"/podcast/wpcampus-2016-retrospective/","author":[{"id":"cc224cb0-f32b-5840-9d1d-c512c0de8162","path":"briandeconinck","display_name":"Brian DeConinck","email":"bpdeconi@ncsu.edu","twitter":"BrianDeConinck","website":"http://www.briandeconinck.com/","company":"NC State University","company_position":"Front-End Designer & Developer","bio":"I build custom themes and plugins for NC State University's Office of Information Technology, and I help maintain campus WordPress environments and advise clients on content best practices.
