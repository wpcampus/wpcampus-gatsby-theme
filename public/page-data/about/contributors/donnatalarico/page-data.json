Often, the success of our stories depends on our success as interviewers. Creating compelling and interesting articles and anecdotes means we must get out our shovels and dig deep. But asking the right questions is only part of it—getting heartfelt answers often only comes when sources feel comfortable with us.\r\n\r\nMarketers can borrow journalistic techniques to improve their storytelling. This session will cover everything from the setup to the follow-up; attendees will learn how to prepare for an interview, maximize time with sources, get subjects talking, organize notes and more. We live in a day where facts are scrutinized more than ever, so this session will also help combat misquotes and mistakes—we’ll cover fact-checking techniques to ensure the accuracy of your stories and prevent those post-publication “that’s not what I said” emails.\r\n\r\nWriters of all backgrounds and skill levels will find actionable takeaways from this session.
