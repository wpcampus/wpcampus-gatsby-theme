Events like WPCampus would not be possible without the support of these <a href=\"https://2018.dev5290.wpcampus.org/sponsors/\">amazing organizations</a>. Be sure to check out their services and say hi to them in St. Louis.</p>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"https://10up.com/\">10up</a> is honored to support WPCampus this year through sponsorship, speaking, and participation.</p>\n<p>A free and robust exchange of ideas and information is central to 10up&#8217;s vision of an open, collaborative internet, and WordPress’s mission to democratize publishing. Those values foster a unique kinship with our partners and clients in academia, which promote similar ideals, through education, research, and open collaboration. It’s no wonder that so many of 10up’s leaders have worked in higher education, including our Chief Executive Officer, John Eckman—a former professor <a href=\"https://2018.dev5290.wpcampus.org/schedule/what-do-other-cms-offer-higher-education/\">who is speaking at this year’s WPCampus</a>.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re gratified to include several academic institutions in our portfolio, from an early HighEdWeb award-winning project for Bates College, to projects of all shapes and sizes for renowned universities like Northeastern, Stanford, UC Davis, and Harvard, to name just a few.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-25556 aligncenter\" src=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/wp-content/uploads/10up-image2-800x457.png\" alt=\"A screenshot of eCorner.

Many universities maintain multiple WordPress sites, often using network (multisite) mode to segregate departments, in addition to one off installations for microsites. Distributor can keep a single piece of content—like an event or course description or professor’s biography—synchronized across multiple sites and departments. During our beta period, we’ve accepted dozens of applicants applying and extending it to higher education.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-25555 aligncenter\" src=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/wp-content/uploads/10up-image1-800x486.png\" alt=\"A screenshot of the WordPress admin for a project for World Park Explorer.\" width=\"800\" height=\"486\" srcset=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/wp-content/uploads/10up-image1-800x486.png 800w, https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/wp-content/uploads/10up-image1-768x467.png 768w, https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/wp-content/uploads/10up-image1-600x365.png 600w, https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/wp-content/uploads/10up-image1.png 928w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>Come find us at WPCampus and discuss the intersection of open source and Higher Education.</p>\n<div class=\"wpc-callout wpc-callout--primary\">\n<p><a href=\"https://2018.dev5290.wpcampus.org/\">WPCampus 2018</a> will take place July 12-14, 2018 on the campus of Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. We hope you can join us for three days filled with sessions, workshops, networking, and social events, all focused on using WordPress in higher education.</p>\n</div>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9822bd00-f7fb-5566-ac1e-e000cd9b2dee","wordpress_id":169,"count":13,"name":"Sponsors","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/sponsors/"},{"id":"a3025401-433e-5124-82fd-e9ac38d13ee3","wordpress_id":170,"count":7,"name":"WPCampus 2018","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/wpcampus-2018/"}]}}]},"allWordpressWpPlanning":{"edges":[]},"allWordpressWpPodcast":{"edges":[]},"allWordpressWpcLibrary":{"edges":[]},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"siteName":"WPCampus: Where WordPress meets higher education"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"5850e6c3-7010-5dc6-913d-4a0da96788de","crumbs":{"crumb":{"path":"/about/contributors/jakemgold/","text":"Jake Goldman"},"parent_element":{"crumb":{"path":"/about/contributors/","text":"Contributors"},"parent_element":{"crumb":{"path":"/about/","text":"About"}}}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2186475492"]}
