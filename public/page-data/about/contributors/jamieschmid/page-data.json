Period.\r\n\r\nYour organization is much more than lecture halls and a beautiful campus. It’s all that, plus online learning, remote students, social media engagement, competition with for-profits and MOCC (massively open online courses), and an audience that is beginning to question the value of a higher education at all. Your target audience varies from curious high school students to overwhelmed faculty to busy alumni.\r\n\r\nColleges and universities produce a ton of content, and it’s never-ending. At its best, content is political, time-consuming and difficult. At its worst, content is disorganized, neglected and inaccessible. Are you ensuring your content is on-brand, using the right tone and written for the correct audience?\r\n\r\nIn this workshop, we will create a framework for implementing content strategy in your organization, with tips for managing content more efficiently. We will explore ideas and tools that can really make a difference in how you create, manage and organize content within your organization.
