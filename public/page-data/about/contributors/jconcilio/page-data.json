She's been interested in computers since she was 8 and first directly dialed to her library's system to reserve books. She's been a web developer for a brand, newspapers, a digital design firm, an advertising firm and now higher education. She loves learning new things or expanding on existing knowledge/techniques, and constantly seeks out new strategies, libraries and systems - but only implements them when it makes the most sense for a given project. In her current work as a web specialist for Penn State College of Medicine and the chief technical officer for Technical Penguins, she advocates for accessibility, good user experience and the use of common sense in development and design.
