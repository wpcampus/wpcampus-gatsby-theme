In 2014 I co-founded Advantage Learn (www.advantagelearn.com), a proudly South African education startup that aims to bring affordable, high-quality high school (Secondary) teaching and support to South Africans by connecting top South African high school educators with learners at a reasonable cost by leveraging technology. This all done on WordPress. In 2015, I co-founded a unique coworking and events space called the Green Door (thegreendoor.org.za) that aims at encouraging learning through building local community and open sharing in the greater Durban area. Through the experience and passion gathered in building AdvantageLearn.com on WordPress, I co-founded Pango, a WordPress development agency and online education support and services house aimed at using WordPress to power online and blended learning. In my spare time I enjoy organising the Durban WordPress meetup, writing code, reading, blogging at jamestrevorlees.me, and spending time with family and friends.","rendered":"<p>I am passionate about three core things; education, code and entrepreneurship.
