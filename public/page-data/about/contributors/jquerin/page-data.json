While my training is in graphic design, I've taught myself web design and development along with a host of different languages to accomplish whatever problems I've needed to solve. Outside of my professional life, I've spent the last 17 years married to my wonderful, talented wife. Together we have two girls, a 15-year-old in her first year of high school, and a 5-year-old who can't wait to start her kindergarten year later this fall.","rendered":"<p>I have worked in higher ed for the past 17 years.
