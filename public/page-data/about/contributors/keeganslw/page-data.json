Whether you want to host a class blog, publish an open textbook or utilize WordPress plugins within the LMS, you can integrate these tools into your course design using built-in features. This intersection of technologies allows your students to readily create and access web content directly from the LMS to streamline their learning experiences. At the same time this structure allows your online materials to simultaneously exist within the context of the curriculum and the internet at large. This setup readily lends itself to conversations involving web publishing, digital presence, openness and even more learning opportunities.\r\n\r\nJoin us for this technological and pedagogical demonstration that explores the relationship between WordPress, Domain of One’s Own and the LMS and what it can empower you and your students to do in the classroom.
