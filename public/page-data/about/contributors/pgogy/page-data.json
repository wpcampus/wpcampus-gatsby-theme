However, I fully empathize with universities/organizations that have to stay with an older version due to internal policies or change management policies. This is especially true after the release of version 5.0.0 with Gutenberg.  If you use an older version, or have policies in place where you can&#8217;t immediately update to the latest major version of WordPress as soon as it is released, then <strong>I strongly encourage you to weigh in over on the policy proposal page</strong> and have your voice heard.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/plugins/"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/security/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"ef66243a-da66-5e56-9d63-f3416e667a7f","wordpress_id":36403,"type":"post","slug":"vulnerable-plugins-report-for-the-week-of-august-2nd-2019","path":"/blog/2019/08/vulnerable-plugins-report-for-the-week-of-august-2nd-2019/","author":[{"id":"7f4ed30b-8e00-5331-bfb2-ed54dc0fcc41","path":"pgogy","display_name":"Pat Lockley","email":"Info@pgogywebstuff.com","twitter":"Pgogy","website":"https://pgogywebstuff.com","company":"Pgogy webstuff","company_position":"Owner","bio":"Academic technologist and pedagogic outfitter.
