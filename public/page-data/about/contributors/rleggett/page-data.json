These changes have made it painfully obvious that not everyone, and perhaps not even most people, have access to high-speed broadband Internet connections in their homes. This has made it even more of an imperative that we optimize our websites and web applications for performance.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will walk you through how I optimized a Python/Flask web application to improve its Chrome Lighthouse performance score by nearly 50 points and how you can apply some of what I learned to your own WordPress development. You will leave with a concrete list of steps you can take to start making your site faster right away.","rendered":"<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has forced countless teams to pivot to full-time remote work and schools across the country to move to online-only or hybrid in-person/online instruction.
