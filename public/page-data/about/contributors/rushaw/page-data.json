We knew WordPress would be the number one application, but we also had a lot of angst in creating a faculty “template” to serve as a starting point for a website. In May of 2018 we purchased an Elementor site license. Now we feel like we can build anything, and themes have become, in some ways, irrelevant.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will demonstrate how Elementor can help users build their dream sites, or just quickly get them up and running with a simple but attractive landing page. I’ll talk about the differences between the free and pro versions; how it eliminates the need to agonize over choosing a theme; how it replaces certain plugins; how the pro version can transform headers, footers, archives, 404’s, etc.; show how in combination with Installatron templates you can offer users ready-made sites easily; and even a mention about Gutenberg and where it fits in. It’s time to stop worrying about your theme, and design the WordPress website you, and your campus community, always wanted.","rendered":"<p>The University of North Florida introduced a Domain of One’s Own to its faculty in September of 2017.
