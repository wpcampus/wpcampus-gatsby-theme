We chose five organizations and asked community members and conference attendees to <a href=\"https://2020.dev5290.wpcampus.org/donate/\" aria-label=\"submit matching donations for WPCampus 2020 online\">submit matching donations</a>.</p>\n<p>With a goal of $3,000 in matched donations, we received $2,340 in submissions. Among our trivia and door prize winners, ten elected to donate their winnings towards a selected organization. These donations increased the total amount by $200. We divided the remaining $460 (towards our $3,000 goal) among the organizations.</p>\n<p>While we didn&#8217;t quite reach our goal of $3,000 in matched donations, the WPCampus organization donated $3,000 and overall helped to raise $5,340. We consider the campaign a great success!</p>\n<p>Here are the numbers donated to each organization. We invite you to <a href=\"https://2020.dev5290.wpcampus.org/donate/\">learn more about each organization</a> and continue to contribute to their cause.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Black Girls Code:</strong> $507 from WPCampus, $882 overall</li>\n<li><strong>Black Lives Matter:</strong> $817 from WPCampus, $1502 overall</li>\n<li><strong>Feeding America:</strong> $327 from WPCampus, $522 overall</li>\n<li><strong>NAACP Legal Defense Fund:</strong> $1,062 from WPCampus. $2,012 overall</li>\n<li><strong>The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU):</strong> $287 from WPCampus, $422 overall</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thank you to all who donated. WPCampus is a community before its a conference. We are humans before we are web professionals. One of our organizational pillars will always be to do what we can to support and care for each other.</p>\n<p>As a side note: we are publishing session recordings from the conference as soon as they are processed.

This will be the final change.</p>\n<p>The first time we changed our dates, it was <a href=\"https://www.dev5290.wpcampus.org/blog/2020/05/wpcampus-2020-online-to-change-dates/\">because of a conflict with DrupalCon</a>. This time the reason is more personal. To put it simply, we’ve been listening to feedback and feel a three-day event with a half-day of workshops and two days of lectures would be a bit too much for everyone, including organizers and attendees.</p>\n<p>We decided to remove workshops and set the event for two days on Wednesday (July 29), and Thursday (July 30). By leaving Friday open, we hope that attendees will be more likely to focus on the event because they can use Friday to get caught up on work before the weekend.</p>\n<p>We want to allow everyone to enjoy our time together. When you attend our event in-person, you’re physically separated from your work environment. While responsibilities and distractions inevitably pop up, the physical distance makes it easier to focus on learning and networking. Achieving this work boundary is more of a struggle in an online environment.</p>\n<p>We recognize that while attending an online event, you’ll most likely be sitting at your workstation. We want to be mindful of your time and duration of online activity. We want to foster opportunities where you’re more likely to detach from work and focus on your professional development.</p>\n<h2>Introducing initiative for recurring workshops</h2>\n<p>We know the value workshops and similar extended session formats can bring to learn more about a specific topic. We do not want to remove this value from our community.</p>\n<p>Instead of limiting workshops to our conferences, we’re introducing an initiative to host recurring workshops, seminars, or classes throughout the year, hopefully monthly or bi-monthly. We’re excited by the opportunity for increased professional development, networking, and time we can spend together.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in driving this initiative forward, we have published a few surveys and would love your feedback. We’re also looking for topics and presenters.</p>\n<p><a class=\"wpc-button wpc-button--primary wpc-button--larger\" href=\"https://www.dev5290.wpcampus.org/community/surveys/workshops/\">Complete the WPCampus workshop surveys</a></p>\n<h2>WPCampus is matching donations</h2>\n<p>One of our WPCampus traditions is to use the “previously allocated to swag” portion of our event income to support a nonprofit organization.

The event will cover a variety of topics, all focused on the growth of Higher Education, Accessibility, WordPress, and its people.</p>\n<h2>A new schedule</h2>\n<p>In the past, our event has taken place Thursday through Saturday, but we listened to your feedback and moved our program to Wednesday through Friday.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re excited about this change and what it means for the event. The new program will give in-person attendees more time to visit New Orleans over the weekend before they return home.</p>\n<p>We also noticed a drop off of live stream viewers on Saturday so we hope this change will allow our virtual attendees to enjoy the entire program during their workday.</p>\n<h2>An amazing city</h2>\n<p>New Orleans is a beautiful and lively city that we can&#8217;t wait to explore it with our community. We&#8217;re on the lookout for social and networking events. Our Slack is already filled with discussions of cooking classes, historic tours, and the best places to eat.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve never been to New Orleans, we can&#8217;t recommend it enough. We hope you can join us and experience the fun for yourself.</p>\n<h2>What to expect</h2>\n<p>While the format of our event is similar to a WordCamp, our entire program is focused on Higher Education and Accessibility, which allows for a richer and more fine-tuned experience for our attendees.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll never want to miss a session because they&#8217;re tailored just for you, a web professional who builds WordPress websites for Higher Education. Take advantage of face-to-face discussions with fellow attendees who also know what it’s like to build websites in Higher Ed.</p>\n<p>Share with, learn from, and be inspired by, your peers.</p>\n<p>The schedule isn’t finalized but you can <a href=\"https://2020.dev5290.wpcampus.org/schedule/\">visit the schedule page</a> to know what to expect, especially for those who will be joining us for the first time in New Orleans.</p>\n<p>For those who can’t make the trip, we expect to continue our tradition of live streaming our sessions.</p>\n<p>To learn more about the content we provide, you can access recordings from past events in the <a href=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/library/\">WPCampus Learning Library</a> or on the <a href=\"https://2019.dev5290.wpcampus.org/schedule/\">WPCampus 2019 website</a>.</p>\n<h2>On-campus lodging</h2>\n<p>We’re excited to offer on-campus housing again for this year’s event, which really helps to keep travel costs low. We’ll post information as soon as its available.</p>\n<h2>Become a speaker</h2>\n<p>If you’d like to speak at the event, be on the lookout for our call for proposals!</p>\n<p>Accepted speakers receive free admission and hordes of gratefulness and admiration for your investment in Higher Education.

In early 2019, we <a href=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/2019/01/gutenberg-audit-vendor/\">announced our selection of Tenon, LLC</a> to conduct the audit, at a cost of $31,200.</p>\n<p>Today, we’re excited to release Tenon’s report on the accessibility of the new editor.</p>\n<p>This report was made possible by the extraordinary generosity of <a href=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/audit/#donors\">more than 100 members of the WordPress community</a>, who collectively contributed $10,264 to fund this project. We’re also grateful to Matt Mullenweg and Automattic, who pledged to ensure that the audit would be fully funded and are covering the balance of the cost of this effort.</p>\n<p>In addition, this audit would not be possible without the <a href=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/2019/01/gutenberg-audit-vendor/\">members of our vendor selection committee</a>. These amazing and talented people donated their time and energy to review proposals, ask smart questions, and ensure that the report we’re sharing today would be valuable to our community.</p>\n<h2>Why WPCampus commissioned a Gutenberg audit</h2>\n<p>WPCampus values accessibility. Our participants are particularly sensitive to <a href=\"https://www.section508.gov/\">their institutions’ legal obligations to provide accessible technologies</a>.</p>\n<p>Beyond those legal obligations, colleges and universities worldwide have committed to providing their communities an accessible digital experience. The uncertainty surrounding the accessibility of Gutenberg makes it difficult for institutions using WordPress to plan their transition to the new editor.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, WPCampus commissioned an accessibility audit to provide our participating institutions (and the broader WordPress community) with an independent assessment. This audit is a resource to help make informed decisions.</p>\n<h2>What was tested</h2>\n<p>Tenon began their testing of the editor in January 2019 on the most current version of WordPress at that time, version 5.0.3.</p>\n<p>WordPress versions 5.1 and 5.1.1 (released while Tenon was testing) contained updates made in Gutenberg version 4.8. These updates included <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=label%3AAccessibility+closed%3A2018-12-12..2019-01-03\">four resolved accessibility issues</a>.</p>\n<p>At the time of this writing, an <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=label%3AAccessibility+closed%3A%3E2019-01-03\">additional 116 issues related to accessibility</a> have been closed thanks to the efforts of the WordPress Accessibility Team and Gutenberg contributors. These changes are targeted for inclusion in WordPress version 5.2 in early May.</p>\n<p>Some of Tenon’s findings may overlap with many of these closed issues. This report is best understood as a snapshot of the state of the editor in early 2019, and as a reference document for measuring continuing progress toward accessibility.</p>\n<h2>How to read this report</h2>\n<p>As we prepared to publish the audit results, we had an internal discussion about how this report might be received by the broader WordPress community. We’d like to address that here.</p>\n<p>An inaccessible editing experience has real and significant consequences for many people in our community. The findings provided by Tenon are serious, and deserve to be considered with thought and care.</p>\n<p>These findings should not be used as fodder for out-of-context quotes on social media or in blog comments. Please refrain from using this report as a means to attack others.</p>\n<p>Please use this report as what it is intended to be: <strong>constructive feedback in support of the WordPress project</strong>. We hope this report generates discussion about accessibility, excitement about inclusive design, and action toward improving the editing experience.</p>\n<p>This report is valuable for anyone working on a complex user interface. Please use this report as an educational resource to help guide and assess your future projects.</p>\n<h2>Results of the accessibility audit</h2>\n<h3>Overview</h3>\n<p>Tenon has provided WPCampus with the following documents:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A 34-page <a href=\"https://documents.dev5290.wpcampus.org/gutenberg/audit/Gutenberg_Executive_Summary.pdf\">Executive Summary</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://documents.dev5290.wpcampus.org/gutenberg/audit/Gutenberg_Test_Plan.pdf\">Tenon’s testing plan</a>, which groups features of the editor into testing components</li>\n<li>A 329-page long-form <a href=\"https://documents.dev5290.wpcampus.org/gutenberg/audit/Gutenberg_Report.pdf\">technical report</a> describing the logged issues in detail</li>\n<li>A summary document describing <a href=\"https://documents.dev5290.wpcampus.org/gutenberg/audit/Gutenberg_UX_Report.pdf\">Tenon’s usability testing</a></li>\n<li>A <a href=\"https://documents.dev5290.wpcampus.org/gutenberg/audit/Gutenberg_All_Issues.csv\">CSV file containing the issues logged</a> during the technical audit</li>\n<li>A <a href=\"https://documents.dev5290.wpcampus.org/gutenberg/audit/Tenon_Audit_Report_Issue_Import_Guide.docx\">guide to importing the CSV file</a> into issue tracking tools</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To help facilitate improvements to the editor based on these findings, Tenon has created a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/created_by/karlgroves\">collection of issues on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<h3>Recommendation for site administrators (and general WordPress users)</h3>\n<p>The Executive Summary document contains the most immediately relevant information for site administrators. That document describes the findings of the audit and the potential impact of the new editor for content creators.</p>\n<p>The user-based testing report is also recommended reading. This document provides insight into the particular challenges of using the editor for some in our community. We believe this is important context for understanding the necessity of making the editor accessible.</p>\n<h3>Recommendation for WordPress core contributors and web developers</h3>\n<p>As with site administrators, we recommend web developers begin with the Executive Summary and the report from Tenon’s user-based testing. In addition, we recommend developers prioritize the long-form technical report.</p>\n<p>We encourage WordPress core contributors to review all of the audit documents provided by Tenon. This is a substantial time commitment, but will be useful in implementing the changes needed to make the editor more accessible.</p>\n<p>Further, we encourage any web developer to take the time to read and review all of the information provided in this audit. That includes developers not directly involved in the WordPress project. Tenon has compiled a wealth of information, and we’re excited to share it. Examining this report is a tremendous opportunity for professional development, and sets a standard every developer building a complex user interface should aspire to.</p>\n<h3>Recommendation for higher education institutions that use WordPress</h3>\n<p>WPCampus commissioned this audit to provide an independent assessment to institutions that use WordPress, and not to provide any specific guidance or legal advice. This information may be used to determine potential legal risk, challenges, or impact faced by using the Gutenberg editor.</p>\n<p>We recommend that your web team review the report. We also recommend that you share it with your IT accessibility office and/or your disability services office.</p>\n<p>The WPCampus Slack community is always available as a place to share ideas, concerns, and strategies.

We look forward to working with the team at Tenon over the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>Thank you to all of the companies who responded to our RFP.

So far, WPCampus has raised over $10,000, contributed by over 100 generous individuals, organizations, and companies across the WordPress community. In addition, we are particularly grateful to <a href=\"https://automattic.com/\">Automattic and Matt Mullenweg</a>, who pledged to cover the remaining balance to fund our accessibility audit just prior to WordCamp US 2018.</p>\n<p>The final cost of the audit will be just under $31,200.</p>\n<p>We will leave the fundraising drive open until <del>Friday, February 8</del> Thursday, February 28 to allow more of the community to participate. We hope you’ll join us in this important project to ensure an accessible editing experience for all users.</p>\n<p>In addition to contributing financially, some of our donors shared <a href=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/2018/11/fundraising-for-wpcampus-gutenberg-accessibility-audit/#donors\">personal messages about why they value accessibility</a>. We encourage you to take a few minutes to read some of these messages.</p>\n<p>We deeply appreciate each and every one of you who chose to support our effort, as well as those who weren’t able to donate but helped us publicize the fundraiser. Your support is a strong statement that accessibility matters to our community.</p>\n<h2>About the Audit</h2>\n<p>The institutions that participate in WPCampus face legal obligations to provide their academic communities with an accessible digital experience. But beyond our legal obligations, the broader culture of higher education values inclusivity and an exchange of ideas free from artificial barriers.</p>\n<p>While the WordPress accessibility coding standards require new code to meet WCAG 2.0 AA, the new editor has not received a full accessibility audit. Lacking such an audit, the overall accessibility of Gutenberg is unclear. This makes it difficult for colleges and universities to determine the best course of action when deciding how to upgrade to the new editing experience.</p>\n<p>At the conclusion of Tenon&#8217;s testing, WPCampus will publish a public report documenting their findings. Beyond higher education, we hope the audit report will be a valuable resource across the WordPress community. We’re also working with Tenon on some exciting possibilities to help in understanding the audit results, so stay tuned for more announcements!</p>\n<h2>Updated Audit Timeline</h2>\n<p>When we released our <a href=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/2018/10/gutenberg-a11y-audit-rfp/\">request for proposals</a> last October, we included a timeline with a target completion date of January 17, 2019. That timeline has proven to be a little ambitious, which was entirely our fault. All of the amazing vendors who submitted proposals were up to the task of meeting that target date. But our process for evaluating and selecting a vendor ran longer than anticipated, making January 17 impractical.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, here is our updated timeline:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Wednesday, January 9:</strong> Project kickoff</li>\n<li><strong>Thursday, January 31:</strong> Progress update at <a href=\"https://online.dev5290.wpcampus.org/schedule/wpcampus-gutenberg-accessibility-audit/\">WPCampus Online</a></li>\n<li><strong>Late February:</strong> Audit report released</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Selection Committee</h2>\n<p>We received seven spectacular proposals, each with its own testing philosophy and approach.

This audit will help higher education institutions, and the whole WordPress community, make informed decisions about when and how to upgrade to the new editor.</p>\n<p>We received numerous proposals and our selection committee is hard at work, reviewing and evaluating each and every one.

Until our selection committee chooses a vendor, we don’t actually know how much this will cost.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, we’re setting a target fundraising goal somewhere in the middle, between the lowest and highest proposals: <strong>$30,000</strong>.</p>\n<p>When we select a vendor, we’ll announce exactly how much the audit will cost. When you contribute, you’ll have the option of signing up for our newsletter, which will be the best source for updates.</p>\n<p>If the final amount is more than what we raise, we may need to ask for more contributions. If we raise more than we need, we’ll designate the extra money for accessibility efforts like the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Future accessibility audits (either of Gutenberg or of other parts of WordPress)</li>\n<li>Live captioning at our events</li>\n<li>Captioning all our recorded conference sessions and podcasts</li>\n<li>Accessibility professional development opportunities for WPCampus members</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What you get when you donate</h2>\n<p>No fancy swag or Kickstarter-style rewards. But when the accessibility audit is complete, WPCampus will publish the final report, and any supporting documents, on its website. The report will be free and open to the public.</p>\n<p>We’ll also post your name, company, or organization on our website to recognize and thank you for helping make this happen. You may also donate anonymously, if that’s your preference.</p>\n<p><em>FYI: WPCampus is a nonprofit organization, but does not have 501c3 status.

Our organization is sensitive to the legal requirements set by Section 508 of the...</p>\n","content":"<p>WPCampus has released a request for proposals seeking an accessibility audit of the WordPress &#8220;Gutenberg&#8221; editor.</p>\n<p>Our organization is sensitive to the legal requirements set by <a href=\"https://section508.gov/\">Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act</a>. The recent 508 refresh brought these requirements in line with <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/\">WCAG 2.0 level AA</a>, an industry standard that helps ensure accessibility. WCAG 2.0 is also <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/policies/\">commonly used as a baseline for policies</a> governing many WPCampus participants outside the United States, with the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/blog/2018/09/wcag-2-1-adoption-in-europe/\">European Union already moving to WCAG 2.1</a>.</p>\n<p>Beyond our institutions’ legal obligations, colleges and universities worldwide have committed to providing an accessible digital experience to their diverse communities. This is consistent with the broader culture of higher education, which values inclusivity and an exchange of ideas free from artificial barriers.</p>\n<p>While the WordPress accessibility coding standards require new code to meet WCAG 2.0 AA, the new editor has not received a full accessibility audit. Lacking such an audit, the overall accessibility of Gutenberg is unclear. This makes it difficult for colleges and universities to determine the best course of action once WordPress 5.0 is released with Gutenberg as the default editor.</p>\n<h2>Project Goals and Scope</h2>\n<p>WPCampus seeks proposals from accessibility testing vendors to audit the Gutenberg editor. This audit will provide our participating institutions (and the WordPress community at large) an independent assessment that may be used to help determine:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>potential legal risk (if any) posed by upgrading to Gutenberg</li>\n<li>potential challenges when supporting the new editor, particularly for assistive technology users</li>\n<li>potential impact of Gutenberg on the accessibility of public-facing web content</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The final report from the audit (and any appropriate supporting documentation) will be published on the WPCampus website.</p>\n<p>More information about the project scope and deliverables can be found within the RFP.</p>\n<h2>Timeline</h2>\n<p>WordPress 5.0 has a November 19, 2018 scheduled release date. We are looking to have an audit completed and published as soon as possible, so that it can inform decision-making at WPCampus institutions. Commitment to completing an audit ahead of schedule is a plus.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Submission Deadline: </strong><del>November 7, 2018</del> November 14, 2018</li>\n<li><strong>Selection of Vendor:</strong> No later than November 30, 2018</li>\n<li><strong>Completed Audit:</strong> No later than January 17, 2019</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Documents</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/wp-content/uploads/WPCampus-RFP-Accessibility-Audit-of-WordPress-Gutenberg-Editor.pdf\">Request for Proposals: Accessibility Audit of the WordPress Gutenberg Editor</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Additional Information</h2>\n<p>Please refer to the RFP for more information.
