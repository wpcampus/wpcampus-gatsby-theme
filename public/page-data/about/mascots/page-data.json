As WPCampus member Paul Gilzow later shared: &#8220;my brain, however, was having none of it and was convinced that the poodle was a sheep&#8221;. As time ran out, and with no clear answer in mind, Paul took a guess and wrote down &#8220;Truck Sheep&#8221;.</p>\n<p>According to Paul: &#8220;If you’ve never played Telestrations, it is quite hilarious to see how the initial phrase morphs as it moves from player-to-player. When it came around, “Truck Sheep” struck our funny bones, and most of us in the game were struggling to breathe from laughter.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The next day, Truck Sheep cemented its place in WPCampus history when Paul used the name as his handle during our trivia game at the event&#8217;s closing remarks. The name &#8220;Truck Sheep&#8221; continuously flashed on the large screen whenever the trivia platform displayed the top 3 contestants. By the time Paul won the trivia game, everyone&#8217;s interest was extremely piqued. Paul explained what had happened the night before.</p><figure id=\"attachment_40588\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-40588\" style=\"width: 100px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img class=\"wp-image-40588\" src=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/wp-content/uploads/truck-sheep-1.0.png\" alt=\"The original Truck Sheep illustration was created from a combination of emojis: a truck and a ram.

WPCampus member Mike Henderson created an emoji so we could breathe even more life into our new friend.</p>\n<p>Truck Sheep has continued to live on and bring smiles to our members.</p>\n<p>For <a href=\"https://2019.dev5290.wpcampus.org\">WPCampus 2019</a>, the WPCampus Director, Rachel Cherry, gave Truck Sheep a design upgrade and a new Slack emoji. The update gave our beloved mascot a more versatile appearance and bestowed our friend with WPCampus community colors.</p>\n","wpc_seo":{"title":"","meta":{"description":"The WPCampus community has two official mascots: Eduwapuu and Truck Sheep.
