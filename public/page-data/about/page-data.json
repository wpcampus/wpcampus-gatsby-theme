Our mission is to advance higher education by providing a support structure and wealth of knowledge and networking for anyone who uses, or is interested in using, WordPress in the world of higher education.</p>\n<p>We also support and organize <a href=\"/conferences/\">multiple conferences</a>.</p>\n<p>Much like online businesses or blogging, higher education is &#8220;enterprise on a budget&#8221;, a world of its own with unique challenges, content, stakeholders, and target audiences. Higher education is WordPress at the enterprise level but we don’t worry so much about which e-commerce plugin is best. Instead, we’re more concerned with managing large-scale networks of faculty blogs, abiding with FERPA and accessibility regulations, and implementing tools to promote research data.</p>\n<p>WPCampus members are using WordPress to power learning management systems, intranets, large university websites, and whatever else is needed to support their institution.</p>\n<p>The world of higher ed is a great candidate for utilizing WordPress to its full potential, whether it’s using the powerful CMS to stretch limited resources or using its API capabilities to share information and break down silos.</p>\n<h2>What is WPCampus?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>A community and resources for people who use WordPress in higher education.</li>\n<li>Our mission is to advance higher education.\n<ul>\n<li>At this time, we mainly focus on professional development and networking for those who work in higher ed.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>We have <a href=\"/conferences/\">two conferences a year</a>\n<ul>\n<li>An in-person event in July</li>\n<li>A virtual event in January</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>We also have a <a href=\"/blog/\">blog</a>, <a href=\"/podcast/\">podcast</a>, and <a href=\"/resources/\">resources</a>.</li>\n<li>We work with, and receive support from, <a href=\"/about/partners/\">amazing partners</a></li>\n<li>All of our conference sessions are recorded and placed online for free.\n<ul>\n<li>You can watch them <a href=\"/videos/\">on our website</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Most of our action takes places in our Slack account.\n<ul>\n<li>You can join by <a href=\"/community/membership/\">submitting our membership form</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Wish to contribute to our blog?\n<ul>\n<li>That would be wonderful!

She loves going to WordCamps but there was never content focused on the topics she wanted to discuss as a higher education web specialist. The idea for the conference all started with a tweet in August 2015&#8230;</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Ooh. Dream with me: &quot;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordCampus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WordCampus</a>: A WordCamp for folks using <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WordPress</a> in Higher Education.&quot; I like it. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/heweb?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#heweb</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/m1zEkpkP4B\">https://t.co/m1zEkpkP4B</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Rachel Cherry (@bamadesigner) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bamadesigner/status/628324358126235648?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 3, 2015</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>&#8230; and has since formed into a widespread community of over 900 members and 6 conferences.</p>\n<h2>How to get involved</h2>\n<p>Starting in the fall of 2015, WPCampus has become a thriving online community of networking, resources, events, and more.
