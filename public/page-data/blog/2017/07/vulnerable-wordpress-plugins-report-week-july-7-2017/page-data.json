That&#8217;s the fewest number of disclosures in a week since I started doing this report.  You&#8217;ll notice <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-statistics/\">WP Statistics</a> made a repeat appearance after being on <a href=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/2017/06/vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-week-june-30-2017/\">last week&#8217;s report</a> for a <a href=\"https://blog.sucuri.net/2017/06/sql-injection-vulnerability-wp-statistics.html\">SQL Injection vulnerability</a>.  This week&#8217;s appearance is due to an Authenticated Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability <a href=\"http://blog.dewhurstsecurity.com/2017/07/03/wp-statistics-authenticated-xss-vulnerability.html\">discovered</a> by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ethicalhack3r\">Ryan Dewhurst</a>  of <a href=\"https://dewhurstsecurity.com/\">Dewhurst Security</a> and <a href=\"https://wpscan.org/\">WPScan</a>.</p>\n<p><a class=\"button expand\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CDipP851fxxO1ojCPT8s53q4Y2Hb3NSIwptLk_cm-YM/edit?usp=sharing\">View this week&#8217;s vulnerable plugins list</a></p>\n<h2>Other Security News</h2>\n<p>For those of you running <a href=\"https://www.joomla.org/\">Joomla!</a>, <a href=\"https://www.joomla.org/announcements/release-news/5709-joomla-3-7-3-release.html\">3.7.3 was released</a> earlier this week on July 4th.  Version 3.7.3 addressed three security issues (two Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities, and an Information Disclosure vulnerability) and over 230 bug fixes and improvements.</p>\n<h2>Other WordPress News</h2>\n<p>There are <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=accepted&amp;status=assigned&amp;status=new&amp;status=reopened&amp;status=reviewing&amp;milestone=4.8.1&amp;group=component&amp;col=id&amp;col=summary&amp;col=milestone&amp;col=status&amp;col=owner&amp;col=type&amp;col=priority&amp;col=changetime&amp;order=changetime\">80+ bug fixes and enhancements</a> being worked on for version 4.8.1 and is currently scheduled for a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/07/07/4-8-1-bug-scrubs/\">late July release</a>.  If you don&#8217;t have automatic updates enabled, start prepping to update your sites.  I meant to mention this last week, but the plugin team <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2017/06/28/2017-community-summit-notes/\">announced</a> last week that they are moving to open up plugin reviews to <em>anyone</em> with a wordpress.org account.  I haven&#8217;t seen the specifics of how they intend this new review process to work, but typically more eye-balls on a problem is better.  Hopefully, by having more people involved in the review process, potential security issues will be caught before being made publicly available.  I&#8217;m also hoping this means that updates to plugins will be reviewed, whereas now, updates to a plugin are not reviewed at all.  In addition, they announced that there will be announcements for when a plugin is removed from the repository.  Finally!  Again, they haven&#8217;t released how this will work, or what the announcements will look like, but I&#8217;m excited they are moving in this direction.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","slug":"plugins"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","slug":"security"}],"wpc_seo":{"title":"","meta":{"description":"Vulnerable Plugins Only four plugins with disclosed vulnerabilities this week, none of which remain unpatched!
