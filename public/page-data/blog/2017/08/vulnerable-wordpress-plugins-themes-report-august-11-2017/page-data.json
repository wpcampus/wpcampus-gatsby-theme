One of the interesting items was the increased attacks on <a href=\"https://wp-rocket.me/\">wp-rocket</a> which had a Local File Inclusion vulnerability disclosed at the end of July (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zTfpdEKzquGdk6y7lztnt0E18yZLe_8hH5V1AFN4474/edit?usp=sharing\">see the July 28th Vulnerable Plugins Report</a>). This highlights how critical it is to keep your plugins up-to-date as attackers are most definitely targeting these vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>Next, <a href=\"https://sucuri.net/\">Sucuri</a> did a great <a href=\"https://blog.sucuri.net/2017/08/website-backups-using-command-line-tools.html\">post</a> earlier this week on creating website backups with no plugins, just ssh + command line tools. Having a good, clean back up of your files and database is a <em>critical</em>, yet often over-looked component of a solid security strategy.  If you already have a plugin that creates scheduled backups and stores them offsite (please don&#8217;t store your backups on the same server as your website), then you are one step ahead of most. However, if you&#8217;ve ever been in the situation where a plugin won&#8217;t work, or you can&#8217;t find one that supports storing to a particular storage service, you don&#8217;t necessarily <strong>need</strong> a plugin.  By using ssh and some <a href=\"https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Bash_Shell_Scripting\">bash scripting</a> you can back up your site(s) and store them to any service needed.  Definitely check out their post and don&#8217;t be afraid to get your hands dirty in the terminal!</p>\n<h2>Other Security News</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/\">PostgreSQL</a> released <a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/1772/\">critical updates</a> yesterday for all of their supported versions (9.6.X, 9.5.X, 9.4.X, 9.3.X, and 9.2.X).  The update addresses three vulnerabilities: e<a href=\"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-7546\">mpty passwords accepted as valid in certain authentication methods</a>, <a href=\"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-7547\">information disclosure</a>, and <a href=\"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-7548\">privilege escalation.</a>  If you administer a system that runs PostgreSQL, you are encouraged to update as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://apache.org/\">Apache Software Foundation</a> also released critical updates yesterday for the <a href=\"https://subversion.apache.org/\">Subversion client.</a>  The updates address two vulnerabilities: <a href=\"https://subversion.apache.org/security/CVE-2016-8734-advisory.txt\">denial of service attack</a>, and <a href=\"https://subversion.apache.org/security/CVE-2017-9800-advisory.txt\">arbitrary code execution</a>. These vulnerabilities are particularly interesting because the attacks target subversion <em>clients</em> not necessarily the subversion server, with the code execution being especially concerning:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;A maliciously constructed svn+ssh:// URL would cause Subversion clients to run an arbitrary shell command. Such a URL could be generated by a malicious server, by a malicious user committing to a[sic] honest server (to attack another user of that server&#8217;s repositories), or by a proxy server.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>You&#8217;ll need to update your subversion client, which could prove interesting if your subversion client is embedded in your IDE, or the package you use sits on top of subversion&#8217;s client.  You&#8217;ll need to check with your vendor for an update.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","slug":"plugins"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","slug":"security"}],"wpc_seo":{"title":"","meta":{"description":"Vulnerable Plugins/Themes Eleven disclosures this week, with two issues unfixed.
