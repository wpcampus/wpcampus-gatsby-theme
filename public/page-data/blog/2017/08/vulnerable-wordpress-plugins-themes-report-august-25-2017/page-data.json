The fix is easy enough: at the beginning of the process, ensure the user is authorized.  Luckily, WordPress makes this easy for us through the function <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/current_user_can\">current_user_can()</a> which you can use to check to make sure the user has the needed capabilities (permissions) necessary to perform an action or access a resource.</p>\n<p><code><br />\nfunction my_awesome_function()<br />\n{<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if(current_user_can('edit_others_posts'){<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//do stuff<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br />\n}<br />\n</code></p>\n<p>Like many things in secure coding, the fix isn&#8217;t insurmountable, you just have to know what to do and remember to do it!</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","slug":"plugins"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","slug":"security"}],"wpc_seo":{"title":"","meta":{"description":"Vulnerable Plugins/Themes Seven disclosures this week, with zero issues unfixed.
