If you haven&#8217;t head about it yet, I strongly recommend you read the <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/09/breach-at-equifax-may-impact-143m-americans/\">write up</a> by Brian Krebs over at <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/\">krebsonsecurity.com</a>. The TL;DR is</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Equifax</strong>, one of the “big-three” U.S. credit bureaus, said today a data breach at the company may have affected 143 million Americans, jeopardizing consumer Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses and some driver’s license numbers.</p></blockquote>\n<p>To put that in perspective, the U.S. population is just shy of <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/popclock/\">325 million</a>; this means 45% of the <strong>entire</strong> United States population is affected by this breach.  Given the numbers, there&#8217;s a very good chance you were involved in the leak.  Equifax has a <a href=\"https://trustedidpremier.com/eligibility/eligibility.html\">site set up</a> where you can <a href=\"https://trustedidpremier.com/eligibility/eligibility.html\">check to see</a> if your information was included in the leak. They are offering twelve months of credit monitoring service through TrustedID Premiere (interestingly, TrustedID is a wholly owned subsidary of Equifax).  However, before you enroll, be sure to read the <a href=\"https://trustedidpremier.com/static/terms\">terms of service</a> as enrolling waives your rights to sue, or be a member of a class-action suit against Equifax in the future. If you&#8217;re worried about not having the monitoring in place, read Krebs&#8217; article on <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/11/report-everyone-should-get-a-security-freeze/\">credit file freezes</a>.</p>\n<p>So far Equifax has not disclosed how the breach occurred, only that they discovered &#8220;unauthorized access&#8221; by &#8220;exploiting an application vulnerability.&#8221; While we do not know yet if WordPress was involved in the breach, it is interesting that the www.equifaxsecurity2017.com site is <a href=\"https://www.equifaxsecurity2017.com/wp-content/themes/sierra_2017/style.css\">running WordPress</a>, and up until a few hours ago, was still leaking user names via the user REST API endpoint.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-15641 aligncenter\" src=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/wp-content/uploads/equifax-users-800x167.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"167\" srcset=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/wp-content/uploads/equifax-users-800x167.jpg 800w, https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/wp-content/uploads/equifax-users-768x160.jpg 768w, https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/wp-content/uploads/equifax-users.jpg 908w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>Another <a href=\"https://lgtm.com/blog/apache_struts_CVE-2017-9805_announcement\">large disclosure</a> this week was with the <a href=\"https://struts.apache.org/\">Apache Struts framework</a> which involved an issue with the framework&#8217;s REST plugin, whereby arbitrary code execution could occur via unsafe deserialization. This is a critical vulnerability and you are encouraged to <a href=\"https://struts.apache.org/announce.html\">update</a> immediately if you are using Struts.  Deserialization is complicated to protect against, and is coming becoming a big enough issue that it <a href=\"https://github.com/OWASP/Top10/issues/92\">might be included</a> in the OWASP Top 10 for 2017.</p>\n<p>Speaking of the OWASP Top 10, yet another <a href=\"https://www.upguard.com/breaches/cloud-leak-tigerswan\">disclosure this week</a> highlighted why knowing how and where your sensitive data is being stored is so critical (<a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A6-Sensitive_Data_Exposure\">A6: Sensitive Data Exposure</a>).  A Researcher from Upguard discovered a publicly accessible AWS storage bucket containing 9,400 resumes from people who had applied for a job at TigerSwan, an international security company. However, the information wasn&#8217;t left in the storage bucket by TigerSwan, but by a recruiting vendor TigerSwan had previously hired.  Even if TigerSwan followed all best practices for securing data, sharing that data with a vendor who failed to do so has damaged their reputation, and more importantly, left the individuals who trusted them with their data vulnerable to identity theft.</p>\n<h2>Opportunities</h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in Application Security, tradepub.com is offering a couple of good security-related eBooks for free right now: <em><a href=\"http://webcodegeeks.tradepub.com/free/w_pacb47/\">Penetration Testing &#8211; A Survival Guide</a></em> and <em><a href=\"http://webcodegeeks.tradepub.com/free/w_aaaa5051/\">Web Application Security for Dummies</a></em>.
