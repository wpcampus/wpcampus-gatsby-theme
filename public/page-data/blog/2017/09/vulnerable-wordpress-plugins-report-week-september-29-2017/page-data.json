Both have been removed from the public repository.</p>\n<p><a class=\"button expand\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QfksBNVmJCWCzif7AbMnghDGf_yYDdH2eSfgpM4XrQU/edit?usp=sharing\">View this week&#8217;s vulnerable plugins list.</a></p>\n<p>As a point of clarification, since there seems to be some confusion: I am not the discoverer of the vulnerabilities listed in the spreadsheet.  There is a column labeled <strong>Source</strong> that lists the location of where I learned of the disclosure or vulnerability. I subscribe and read hundreds of blogs, exploit databases, security lists etc. trying to find WordPress-related disclosures, and then compile them into the spreadsheet. If I discuss or expand on a particular vulnerability, I do so to help explain the vulnerability: why it&#8217;s a vulnerability, why it&#8217;s critical or how the vulnerability manifest itself.</p>\n<p>The first critical issue in this week&#8217;s list is with the SI CAPTCHA plugin where the original developer <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/where-did-the-plugin-go-2/\">revealed</a> that he transferred ownership of the plugin to another developer.  The new developer then proceeded to insert code into the plugin that could be used to display spam posts in a manner similar to what happened with the <a href=\"http://strategy11.com/display-widgets/\">Display Widgets plugin</a>.  WordPress.org Admin &#8220;Otto&#8221; has <a href=\"https://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/si-captcha-for-wordpress/tags/3.0.3/\">released</a> a clean <a href=\"https://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/si-captcha-for-wordpress/tags/3.0.3/\">version 3.0.3</a> with the malicious code removed but warns there will be no further updates and that you should begin looking for a replacement.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","slug":"plugins"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","slug":"security"}],"wpc_seo":{"title":"","meta":{"description":"Vulnerable Plugins Eleven disclosures this week, with two issues unfixed, both critical.
