At the time of discovery, the vulnerability was being actively exploited in the wild.  The author has released <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/ultimate-form-builder-lite/#developers\">version 1.3.7</a>, so please make sure you have updated.</p>\n<p>For this week&#8217;s unfixed vulnerabilities, the Full Path Disclosure issue with the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/image-upload-for-bbpress/\">Inline Image Upload for BBPress</a> (and it&#8217;s <a href=\"https://potentplugins.com/downloads/image-upload-for-bbpress-pro-wordpress-plugin/\">Pro version</a>) isn&#8217;t a vulnerability by itself, but can be used in combination with other attacks that require knowing the server path. Hopefully the vendor will release a fix soon, but if not, you can mitigate this issue by ensuring display_errors is disabled for php for your site.  The specifics of how you disable it will depend on your hosting set up.  If you&#8217;re not sure, contact your hosting provider or system administrator.</p>\n<h2>Other WordPress News</h2>\n<p>WordPress version 4.9 is currently in Beta 4 with a Release Candidate scheduled for this Monday, with a final target release date of  Tuesday, November 14th.  It&#8217;s always a good idea to test out Release Candidates in your development environments, if possible.  If not, start preparing to update your sites mid-November.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","slug":"plugins"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","slug":"security"}],"wpc_seo":{"title":"","meta":{"description":"Vulnerable Plugins Nine disclosures this week, with five issues unfixed.
