Luckily, there weren&#8217;t any critical vulnerabilities disclosed last week. I&#8217;ve compiled all of last week&#8217;s disclosures into the list for this week&#8217;s.</p>\n<h2>Other Security News</h2>\n<p>The big news, in my opinion, late last week was the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vanderaj/status/918983325770858496\">announcement</a> of the <a href=\"https://github.com/OWASP/Top10/blob/master/2017/OWASP-Top-10-2017-en.pdf\">second release candidate for the OWASP Top Ten 2017</a>.  As with the first release candidate, A4-2013 Insecure Direct Object References and A7-2013 Missing Function Level Access Controls were merged into the new A6-2017 Access Control.  Removed from the 2013 list are A8-2013 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and A10-2013 Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards. When <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vanderaj/status/919286279585480705\">I asked</a> about A8&#8217;s removal, the current project lead replied that it was number thirteen in their data set, and exploitable in 4% of pen test results.  In our internal audits of systems on campus, CSRF is a consistent, exploitable issue.  But then, higher education almost always lags behind the rest of the industry.  A3-2013 Cross-Site Scripting has been moved to position seven (A7-2017), and two new entries have been added: A4-2017 XML External Entity (XXE) and A10-2017 Insufficient Logging and Monitoring.  I won&#8217;t try to explain XXE as <a href=\"https://sensepost.com/blog/2014/revisting-xxe-and-abusing-protocols/\">this sensepost blog post</a> does a much better job than I could, but I am surprised this issue rose to the level of making it into the top 10.  I haven&#8217;t seen any XXE issues in our internal scans for some time.  A10-2017 Insufficient Logging and Monitoring was named A7-2017 Insufficient Attack Protection in the first Release Candidate and caused <a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/3192505/security/contrast-security-responds-to-owasp-top-10-controversy.html\">quite</a> <a href=\"http://www.skeletonscribe.net/2017/04/abusing-owasp.html\">a bit</a> of <a href=\"https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/2017-owasp-top-10-a7/\">drama</a> in the security community, despite Dave Wichers&#8217; excellent job of <a href=\"http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-topten/2017-April/001410.html\">explaining the intent </a>behind its entry. I&#8217;m glad they&#8217;ve renamed it to describe the issue more accurately, but it will be interesting to see if it is accepted by the security community.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","slug":"plugins"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","slug":"security"}],"wpc_seo":{"title":"","meta":{"description":"Vulnerable Plugins Seventeen disclosures over the last two weeks, with six issues unfixed.
