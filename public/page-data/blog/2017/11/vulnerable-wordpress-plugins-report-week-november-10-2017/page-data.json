If your institution is like mine, they only patch servers once a month.  In this case, the patch was released after the patch window for October, and well before the window for November. I would encourage you to check your institution&#8217;s version to see what version you have installed and work with your system administrator(s) to do an emergency patch if you are running a vulnerable version.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","slug":"plugins"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","slug":"security"}],"wpc_seo":{"title":"","meta":{"description":"Vulnerable Plugins Six disclosures this week, with three issues unfixed.
