The patch even got its own haiku (courtesy of <a href=\"https://pagely.com/blog/2017/10/security-haiku-wordpress-4-8-3/\">pagely.com</a>):</p>\n<blockquote><p>WordPress Halloween.<br />\nWe patch the tricks, 4 8 3<br />\nYou get the treats. Boo!</p></blockquote>\n<p>The vulnerability was initially discovered by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ircmaxell\">Anothony Ferrara</a> who worked with the WordPress security team to get the patch in place.  Anthony has a great <a href=\"https://blog.ircmaxell.com/2017/10/disclosure-wordpress-wpdb-sql-injection-technical.html\">write-up</a> covering how he discovered it.  I&#8217;ll echo his statement in that I would like to see WordPress move to <em>real</em> prepared statements, something I&#8217;m surprised hasn&#8217;t been done already.</p>\n<h2>Other Security News</h2>\n<p>If penetration testing, bug hunting, etc. is of interest to you, I&#8217;d suggest checking out <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alxbrsn\">Alex Biran</a>&#8216;s post on how he <a href=\"https://medium.freecodecamp.org/messing-with-the-google-buganizer-system-for-15-600-in-bounties-58f86cc9f9a5\">hacked Google&#8217;s bug tracking system</a>, and was rewarded handsomely. It&#8217;s a great read on the steps he took to find the vulnerability, and his thought process on the actions he took to discover the issues.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","slug":"plugins"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","slug":"security"}],"wpc_seo":{"title":"","meta":{"description":"Vulnerable Plugins Nine disclosures this week, with one issue unfixed, one possibly unfixed (see the notes section in the spreadsheet).
