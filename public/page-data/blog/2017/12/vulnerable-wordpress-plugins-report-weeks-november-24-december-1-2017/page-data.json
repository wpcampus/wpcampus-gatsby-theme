Many of you this week, hopefully, are attending <a href=\"https://2017.us.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp US </a> in beautiful Nashville. If you are, please be sure to say &#8220;hello&#8221; to our colleagues from <a href=\"https://www.vanderbilt.edu/\">Vanderbilt</a> who run a massive, and quite impressive, WordPress instance.</p>\n<h2>WordPress Security News</h2>\n<p>Earlier this week, WordPress version <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/11/wordpress-4-9-1-security-and-maintenance-release/\">4.9.1</a> was released.  In addition to being a maintenance release correcting eleven bugs, 4.9.1 addresses four security issues, so you are strongly encouraged to get the updates scheduled into your Change Management cycle as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>In other WordPress news, <a href=\"https://xwp.co/\">XWP</a> <a href=\"https://xwp.co/tide-a-path-to-better-code-across-the-wordpress-ecosystem/\">announced</a> a new project, <a href=\"https://wptide.org/\">Tide</a>, with an aim to provide automated testing for plugins and themes to assist developers in writing better code.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Tide, a project started here at XWP and supported by Google, Automattic, and WP Engine, aims to equip WordPress users and developers to make better decisions about the plugins and themes they install and build.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/tide-project-aims-to-audit-and-score-wordpress-themes-and-plugins-based-on-code-quality#comment-241498\">Comments</a> from some of the XWP employees in the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/tide-project-aims-to-audit-and-score-wordpress-themes-and-plugins-based-on-code-quality\">WPTavern story</a> indicated they will be using the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress-Coding-Standards/WordPress-Coding-Standards\">WordPress Coding Standards rules</a> for <a href=\"https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer\">PHP_CodeSniffer</a> to facilitate some of the testing.  While I&#8217;m not 100% convinced of assigning a grade or star rating to the test results, I applaud any effort to add testing of submitted code to the repository. XWP plans to demonstrate Tide at WCUS this weekend and I look forward to hearing impressions from people who are able to demo it. I hope XWP is able to open up the service shortly so the community can work toward improving the code quality of submitted code.</p>\n<h2>Other Security News</h2>\n<p>Right before Thanksgiving, the <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/\">OWASP foundation</a> <a href=\"https://owasp.blogspot.com/2017/11/owasp-is-pleased-to-announce-release-of.html\">announced</a> the release of the <a href=\"https://github.com/OWASP/Top10/tree/master/2017\">OWASP Top 10 2017 edition</a>.  Three new entries were added in this edition: <a href=\"https://github.com/OWASP/Top10/blob/master/2017/en/0xa8-insecure-deserialization.md\">A8-2017 Insecure Deserialization</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/OWASP/Top10/blob/master/2017/en/0xaa-logging-detection-response.md\">A10-2017 Insufficient Logging and Monitoring</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/OWASP/Top10/blob/master/2017/en/0xa4-xxe.md\">A4-2017 XML External Entities (XXE)</a>. To make room for these new entries, <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A4-Insecure_Direct_Object_References\">A4-2103 Insecure Direct Object References</a> and <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A7-Missing_Function_Level_Access_Control\">A7-2013 Missing Function Level Access Controls</a> were merged into <a href=\"https://github.com/OWASP/Top10/blob/master/2017/en/0xa5-broken-access-control.md\">A5-2017 Broken Access Controls</a>, and two were removed: <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A8-Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF)\">A8-2013 Cross-Site Request Forgery</a> and <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A10-Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards\">A10-2013 Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards</a>.  Cross-Site Scripting continues to be in the Top 10 but was moved from A3 in 2013 to <a href=\"https://github.com/OWASP/Top10/blob/master/2017/en/0xa7-xss.md\">A7</a> in the new list.</p>\n<p>On Black Friday, <a href=\"https://www.blackarch.org/\">BlackArch</a> <a href=\"http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/Nov/42\">announced</a> a new version of BlackArch Linux, with an updated linux kernl and 50 new tools.  <a href=\"https://www.blackarch.org/downloads.html\">Download</a>.</p>\n<p>Not to be outdone, <a href=\"https://www.kali.org/\">Kali Linux</a> also <a href=\"https://www.kali.org/releases/kali-linux-2017-3-release/\">announced</a> the availability of Kali 2017.3, which includes four new tools (<a href=\"https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r\">Sublist3r</a> looks particularly fun) as well as an updated <a href=\"https://www.paterva.com/web7/buy/maltego-clients/maltego-ce.php\">Maltego</a>.  <a href=\"https://www.kali.org/downloads/\">Download</a>.</p>\n<p>Last, if you are running macOS High Sierra, please be sure to apply <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1942?locale=en_US\">update 2017-001</a> as it corrects a serious issue that, under certain conditions, allows anyone with physical access to the machine to login as root.  Ars Technica has a good <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/11/macos-bug-lets-you-log-in-as-admin-with-no-password-required/\">write-up</a> on the issue.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","slug":"plugins"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","slug":"security"}],"wpc_seo":{"title":"","meta":{"description":"Vulnerable Plugins Fifteen disclosures over the last two weeks, with eleven issues unfixed.
