It is a security and maintenance release and addresses a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability and 21 other bugs.  If you do not have auto-updates enabled, definitely get the update into your Change Management schedule as soon as possible.</p>\n<h2>Other Security News</h2>\n<p>Totally unrelated to higher education, but still concerning.  It was <a href=\"http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2018/Jan/63\">disclosed</a> earlier this week that there are multiple vulnerabilities in all ASUS brand routers: predictable session tokens, bypassing IP verification, passwords stored in plain text and logged-in information disclosure. While not necessarily popular as a commercial router, Asus routers are fairly popular among consumers.  Asus has released a firmware for several of the issues, with additional fixes coming in February.  If you own an ASUS router, have it check for a firmware update and then apply it as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>The other one I want to mention, given the use of <a href=\"https://shibboleth.net/\">Shibboleth</a> in Higher Ed, is the <a href=\"https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/en/advisories/rt-sa-2017-013/-truncation-of-saml-attributes-in-shibboleth-2\">disclosure</a> of a possible authorization bypass in Shibboleth last weekend by RedTeam Pentesting. This is connected to the Shibboleth <a href=\"https://shibboleth.net/community/advisories/secadv_20180112.txt\">security advisory</a> that went out on January 12.</p>\n<h2>WPCampus Online</h2>\n<p>Last, I want to make sure everyone is aware that <a href=\"https://online.dev5290.wpcampus.org/\">WPCampus Online</a> is in less than two weeks! We have a fantastic <a href=\"https://online.dev5290.wpcampus.org/schedule/\">schedule</a> lined up this year. As with previous years, this is an entirely free event and an excellent professional development opportunity.  While WPCampus is <em>generally</em> focused on WordPress in Higher Ed, <span class=\"s1\">this year’s online conference features sessions on management practices, marketing, accessibility, and content management as well as general development and WordPress-specific topics.</span></p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","slug":"plugins"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","slug":"security"}],"wpc_seo":{"title":"","meta":{"description":"Vulnerable Plugins Six disclosures since last week, with three issues unfixed.
