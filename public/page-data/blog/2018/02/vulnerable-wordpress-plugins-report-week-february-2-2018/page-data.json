Affected version include v56.0.0 &#8211; 56.0.2, v57.0.0 &#8211; 57.0.4, and v58.0.0. <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/58.0.1/releasenotes/\">Version 58.0.1</a> has been released to address the issue.Â  The default in Firefox is to perform auto-updates, but if you&#8217;ve disabled those, or if you haven&#8217;t launched it in awhile, make sure you are up-to-date.</p>\n<p>I recently came across <a href=\"https://github.com/portswigger/wordpress-scanner\">Burp WP</a>, a WordPress scanning plugin for <a href=\"https://portswigger.net/burp\">Burp Suite</a>. It&#8217;s similar to <a href=\"http://wpscan.org/\">WPScan</a>, and uses the <a href=\"https://wpvulndb.com/\">WPScan Vulnerability Database</a> as its source of vulnerabilities. If you already use Burp for vulnerability scanning, then it&#8217;s nice to be able to include Burp WP to deep-dive into a WordPress site, without having to run WPScan separately.Â  I&#8217;ll be installing it on Monday to give it a test shortly after updating my sites to WordPress 4.9.3.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","slug":"plugins"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","slug":"security"}],"wpc_seo":{"title":"","meta":{"description":"Vulnerable Plugins Seven disclosures since last week, with three issues unfixed.
