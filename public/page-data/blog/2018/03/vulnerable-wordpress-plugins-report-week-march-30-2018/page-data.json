Originally, it was to <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/try-out-gutenberg-call-out-will-be-in-4-9-5-release/\">include administrative dashboard call-outs</a> to try-out <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/\">Gutenberg</a>, but those have now been <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/03/28/wordpress-4-9-5-release-candidate/\">removed</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>the <em>Try Gutenberg</em> callout will ultimately not land in 4.9.5 release. There are still a few issues that need to get fixed before it&#8217;s ready for the level of attention this will bring. It will probably land in a dedicated 4.9.6 release in a few weeks</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Other Security News</h2>\n<p>All currently supported versions of PHP received <a href=\"http://us1.php.net/index.php#id2018-03-30-2\">security updates</a> this week.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","slug":"plugins"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","slug":"security"}],"wpc_seo":{"title":"","meta":{"description":"Vulnerable Plugins Seven disclosures since last week, with one issue unfixed.
