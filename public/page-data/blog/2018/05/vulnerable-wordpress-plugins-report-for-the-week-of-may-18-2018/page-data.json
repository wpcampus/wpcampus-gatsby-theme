However, from what I understand, the core team will eventually enable this release for autoupdates, so if you are worried about it breaking your site, you&#8217;ll need to begin testing sooner rather than later.</p>\n<h2>Other Security News</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/05/service-leaked-locations-of-us-cell-phones-for-free-no-password-required/\">Website leaked real-time location of most US cell phones to almost anyone</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hardcoded-password-found-in-cisco-enterprise-software-again/\">Hardcoded Password Found in Cisco Enterprise Software, Again</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/@evstykas/remote-smart-car-hacking-with-just-a-phone-2fe7ca682162\">Remote smart car hacking with just a phone</a></li>\n</ul>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","slug":"plugins"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","slug":"security"}],"wpc_seo":{"title":"","meta":{"description":"Vulnerable Plugins Eleven disclosures since last week, with one critical unfixed.
