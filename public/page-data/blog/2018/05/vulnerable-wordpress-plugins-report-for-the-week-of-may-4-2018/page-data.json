Windows users of Sourcetree are strongly encouraged to update to version 2.5.5.0.</p>\n<p>Twitter <a href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/company/2018/keeping-your-account-secure.html\">announced yesterday</a> they recently discovered some passwords were being stored in plaintext in internal logs, and were encouraging users to update their passwords.  Interestingly, this announcement was just three days after GitHub <a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/github-accidentally-recorded-some-plaintext-passwords-in-its-internal-logs/\">announced a similar finding</a>. Both companies have said they have not found any evidence that the passwords were stolen or misused.  However, since there is the chance your password was disclosed, it&#8217;s best to go ahead and update them at both services.</p>\n<h2>Other News</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://2018.stlouis.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp St. Louis</a> is coming up next week. Not only will <a href=\"https://2018.stlouis.wordcamp.org/2018/05/03/interview-with-wcstl-speaker-chris-wiegman/\">Chris Wiegman</a> be there as a keynote, <a href=\"https://2018.stlouis.wordcamp.org/speaker/paul-f-gilzow/\">yours truly</a> will be there presenting on <a href=\"https://2018.stlouis.wordcamp.org/session/git-it-under-control-an-introduction-to-git-and-code-management-paul-f-gilzow/\">GIT</a>.
