Events like WPCampus would not be possible without the support of these <a href=\"https://2018.dev5290.wpcampus.org/sponsors/\">amazing organizations</a>. Be sure to check out their services and say hi to them in St. Louis.</p>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"https://campuspress.com/\">CampusPress</a> is thrilled to help support WPCampus for the 3rd year in a row. Don’t tell anyone else, but it has proven to be our favorite event of the year &#8211; and selfishly, the best professional development that we can experience ourselves. For those on our team that can’t attend, we all but require watching sessions and internal discussion about all of the learning that takes place.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://campuspress.com/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-25853\" src=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/wp-content/uploads/CampusPress-logo.png\" alt=\"CampusPress logo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"221\" srcset=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/wp-content/uploads/CampusPress-logo.png 1000w, https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/wp-content/uploads/CampusPress-logo-800x177.png 800w, https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/wp-content/uploads/CampusPress-logo-768x170.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></a></p>\n<p>And this year is shaping up to be no exception! We’re particularly excited about being on the campus of WashU (where we enjoy hosting their <a href=\"https://sites.wustl.edu/\">sites.wustl.edu</a> WordPress network).</p>\n<p>As for CampusPress, you may not know that we have been quietly hosting WordPress for schools and universities longer than anyone else. In fact, our large Edublogs network with over 4 million sites launched before WordPress.com!</p>\n<p>We also pioneered the ‘managed host’ model long before any of the other countless WordPress hosts existed. Our 13+ years of experience and expertise in Multisite at scale arguably can’t be matched.</p>\n<p>But, to be fair, there have been some valid downsides to our hosting model over the years, particularly as WordPress has changed and needs have grown with many of our higher ed customers. In short, we have developed a reputation for being less flexible with developer access than some would like. To some extent, this has been by design historically, to guarantee the reliability and security of sites we host.</p>\n<p>To that end, we’ve been listening and investing heavily, and that’s why at WPCampus we’d love to chat about our <a href=\"https://campuspress.com/blog/new-dedicated-and-private-clusters-now-available/\">new dedicated cluster environments</a> and other measures that we now have in place to be more developer friendly, while keeping to our same high standards as before.</p>\n<p>With our improved flexibility, we continue to be the solution for self-service WordPress Multisite platforms for faculty, staff, and student sites and blogs. We also see more and more networks being launched to serve ePortfolios and direct classroom use (with our Canvas and LTI integrations).</p>\n<p>And more recently, we have a growing number of main and other mission-critical university websites under our guidance, which we’re incredibly excited about.</p>\n<p>In short, if it can be done with WordPress, we can support it, host it, and at any scale.</p>\n<p>We hope to see you in St. Louis!</p>\n<p><a class=\"wpc-button wpc-button--expand\" href=\"https://campuspress.com/\">Learn more about CampusPress</a></p>\n<div class=\"wpc-callout wpc-callout--primary\"><a href=\"https://2018.dev5290.wpcampus.org/\">WPCampus 2018</a> will take place July 12-14, 2018 on the campus of Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. We hope you can join us for three days filled with sessions, workshops, networking, and social events, all focused on using WordPress in higher education.</div>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9822bd00-f7fb-5566-ac1e-e000cd9b2dee","wordpress_id":169,"count":13,"name":"Sponsors","description":"","slug":"sponsors"},{"id":"a3025401-433e-5124-82fd-e9ac38d13ee3","wordpress_id":170,"count":7,"name":"WPCampus 2018","description":"","slug":"wpcampus-2018"}],"wpc_seo":{"title":"","meta":{"description":"This post is part of a series featuring sponsors from our WPCampus 2018 conference.
