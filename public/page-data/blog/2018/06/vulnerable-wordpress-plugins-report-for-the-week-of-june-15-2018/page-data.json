Please be aware that versions before 3.5.0 are vulnerable to a <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Code_Injection\">Remote Code Execution</a> vulnerability that was <a href=\"https://blog.ripstech.com/2018/moodle-remote-code-execution/\">disclosed earlier this week</a>.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","slug":"plugins"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","slug":"security"}],"wpc_seo":{"title":"","meta":{"description":"Vulnerable Plugins Ten disclosures since last week, with two issues unfixed.
