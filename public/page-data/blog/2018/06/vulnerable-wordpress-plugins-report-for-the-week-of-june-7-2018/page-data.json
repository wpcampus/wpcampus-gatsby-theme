The updated report from Talos includes additional routers that are being targeted by the malware, that the malware includes the ability to inject malicious code into the web traffic as it passes through the device, and the ability to brick the device. While rebooting the device helps disrupt the malware, it does not remove it, and there is no easy way to tell if a router has been infected. It&#8217;s important to note though that just because your router might be on Talos&#8217; list that doesn&#8217;t mean your router is infected.  It just means your router is capable of running the malware once infected.  The actual infection has to happen through some other vulnerability, many of which have already been patched by the manufacturer. The problem lies in that most people <em>don&#8217;t</em> patch their home routers, and that detecting an infected router is difficult.  If you have been religiously updating your router, then you are probably safe.  For everyone else, or if you&#8217;re just paranoid, the only safe, reliable way to ensure you&#8217;re not affected is to factory reset the router and then apply all patches/upgrades.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","slug":"plugins"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","slug":"security"}],"wpc_seo":{"title":"","meta":{"description":"Vulnerable Plugins Seventeen disclosures since last week, with three issues unfixed.
