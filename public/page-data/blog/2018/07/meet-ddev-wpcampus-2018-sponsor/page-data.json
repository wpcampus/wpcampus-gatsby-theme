Events like WPCampus would not be possible without the support of these <a href=\"https://2018.dev5290.wpcampus.org/sponsors/\">amazing organizations</a>. Be sure to check out their services and say hi to them in St. Louis.</p>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.drud.com/what-is-ddev/\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-26269 size-full\" style=\"margin: 2em auto; padding: 2em;\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/ddev-logo.png\" alt=\"DDEV logo\" width=\"1200\" height=\"168\" /></a></p>\n<p>With DDEV, we’re making it easier everyday to get your web development work done with dev-to-deploy workflows. It’s the <a href=\"https://www.drud.com/ddev-local/developer-happiness-the-right-tools-for-the-job/\">developer happiness factor</a> that makes the difference in how creative and productive you can be. A big part of that is having a reliable local development environment that just works, so you can get started and not get tangled in chasing down errors.</p>\n<p>DDEV-Local works on Mac, Windows, or Linux. That means no “works on my machine” issues when you collaborate. You can provide a <a href=\"https://www.drud.com/ddev-local/getting-on-the-same-web-page-by-standardizing-local-development/\">standardized web development environment</a> that suits everyone on your team. DDEV-Local works with WordPress, Drupal, or any PHP app you want to use. If you’re considering a <a href=\"https://www.drud.com/ddev-local/docker-containers-vs-vms-for-quick-consistent-local-dev/\">switch from virtual machines</a>, you’ll find this much faster. That means you can switch tasks quickly without any wait.</p>\n<p>Watch a demo of how to <a href=\"https://www.drud.com/ddev-local/one-minute-wordpress/\">set up WordPress in 1 minute</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.drud.com/get-started/\">get started with DDEV today</a>.</p>\n<h2>Stop by and say hi!</h2>\n<p>We’re proud to sponsor WPCampus 2018 and invite you to stop by and say hello.</p>\n<p><a class=\"button expand\" href=\"https://www.drud.com/what-is-ddev/\">Learn more about DDEV by DRUD</a></p>\n<div class=\"wpc-callout wpc-callout--primary\">\n<p><a href=\"https://2018.dev5290.wpcampus.org/\">WPCampus 2018</a> will take place July 12-14, 2018 on the campus of Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. We hope you can join us for three days filled with sessions, workshops, networking, and social events, all focused on using WordPress in higher education.</p>\n</div>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9822bd00-f7fb-5566-ac1e-e000cd9b2dee","wordpress_id":169,"count":13,"name":"Sponsors","description":"","slug":"sponsors"},{"id":"a3025401-433e-5124-82fd-e9ac38d13ee3","wordpress_id":170,"count":7,"name":"WPCampus 2018","description":"","slug":"wpcampus-2018"}],"wpc_seo":{"title":"","meta":{"description":"This post is part of a series featuring sponsors from our WPCampus 2018 conference.
