WordPress has since <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/07/wordpress-4-9-7-security-and-maintenance-release/\">released version 4.9.7</a> which fixes this issue in both locations.  If you haven&#8217;t already, make sure to get this update into change management cycle as soon as possible.</p>\n<h2>Other News</h2>\n<p>We are <strong>one week away</strong> from WPCampus 2018 in beautiful St. Louis, MO!  If you aren&#8217;t to join us this year, no worries!
