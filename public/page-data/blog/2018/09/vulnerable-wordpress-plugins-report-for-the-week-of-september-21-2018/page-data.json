The disclosure includes Proof-of-Concept code so if you haven&#8217;t updated your Moodle instance already, you need to do so <em>as soon as possible</em>.</p>\n<h2>Other News</h2>\n<p>In case you haven&#8217;t heard yet, today is the last day to <a href=\"https://2018.highedweb.org/register/\">register</a> for the <a href=\"https://2018.highedweb.org/\">HighEdWeb 2018</a> conference. If you are unfamiliar, HighEdWeb is the conference for higher education professionals working in the digital space, put on by higher educations professionals working in the digital space. It&#8217;s like WPCampus, but more general.  In fact, many of the people who organize, speak at, and attend WPCampus will be at HighEdWeb.  It&#8217;s the only other conference besides WPCampus that I consider a &#8220;can&#8217;t miss.&#8221; I sincerely hope you&#8217;ll <a href=\"https://2018.highedweb.org/register/\">register</a> (today! Today is the<strong> last day</strong>!) and see you in Sacramento next month!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","slug":"plugins"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","slug":"security"}],"wpc_seo":{"title":"","meta":{"description":"Vulnerable Plugins Ten disclosures since last week, with four issues unfixed, the most serious being an Authenticated Arbitrary File Upload vulnerability in Advanced Contact form 7 DB.
