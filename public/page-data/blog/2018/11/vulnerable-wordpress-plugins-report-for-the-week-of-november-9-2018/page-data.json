Instead, RC1 will now be released on the 19th.  While I would personally like to see this pushed back even further (until next year), this at least gets us past Thanksgiving, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday.</p>\n<p>A second bit of good news came out earlier this week when the core team <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/11/07/classic-editor-plugin-support-window/\">announced</a> they will support the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/\">Classic Editor plugin</a> until December 31, 2021.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Classic Editor plugin will be officially supported until <strong>December 31, 2021</strong>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>While I applaud the core team for committing to long-term support of the Classic Editor plugin, it still doesn&#8217;t address the continued accessibility issues with Gutenberg. If Gutenberg is the future, then we need to make sure it is accessible to <em>everyone</em>. To aid organizations (Higher Education in particular) in the evaluation of adopting Gutenberg, WPCampus is now <a href=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/2018/10/gutenberg-a11y-audit-rfp/\">accepting proposals</a> from accessibility testing vendors to audit the Gutenberg editor. Results from the audit will be published to the WPCampus site.  The deadline for proposal submission is November 14. If you currently work with an accessibility testing vendor, we would greatly appreciate you letting them know of our RFP.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","slug":"plugins"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","slug":"security"},{"id":"7b9f7495-e01f-52fb-8211-386c845eb899","wordpress_id":82,"count":4,"name":"Themes","description":"","slug":"themes"}],"wpc_seo":{"title":"","meta":{"description":"Vulnerable Plugins Eleven disclosures since last week, with three issues unfixed, one unknown.
