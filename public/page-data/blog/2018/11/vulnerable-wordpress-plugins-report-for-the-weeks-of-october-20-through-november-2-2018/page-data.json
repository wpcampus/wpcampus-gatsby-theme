The disclosures that will affect the most people are the stored cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in <a href=\"https://www.elegantthemes.com/\">Elegant Themes&#8217;</a> Divi Builder plugin, Divi theme and Extra theme. If you&#8217;re using those products be sure to get the latest updates from Elegant Themes.</p>\n<p><a class=\"button expand\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ArTj1KlvC_byxAbCUxdqKYMLOfMcCqkg514K23Kg5zE/edit?usp=sharing\">View this week&#8217;s vulnerable plugins list.</a></p>\n<h2>Other WordPress News</h2>\n<p>The march to WordPress 5.0 continues on.  <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/10/wordpress-5-0-beta-2/\">Beta 2 is currently available</a>, with <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-0/\">Beta 3 scheduled for release today</a>,  Beta 4 on Monday, and RC on November 12. My advice is still the same as it was on <a href=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/2018/10/vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-for-the-week-of-october-5-2018/\">October 5</a>: install the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/\">Classic Editor plugin</a>, install WordPress 5.0 when it is released, and then disable auto-updates while monitoring core announcements for security updates. The one change from then is the WPCampus community has put out an <a href=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/2018/10/gutenberg-a11y-audit-rfp/\">RFP for an accessibility audit on Gutenberg</a>, so I would suggest <a href=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/get-involved/\">joining the WPCampus slack workspace</a> to stay up-to-date as the audit progresses and to see the results. From there, you&#8217;ll have a much better idea as to whether or not you can implement Gutenberg on your campus.</p>\n<p>And I&#8217;m not the only one making this suggestion. The web team at NC State University has <a href=\"https://design.oit.ncsu.edu/2018/10/24/gutenberg-accessibility/\">released a similar suggestion</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>1. Before November 19, install and activate the Classic Editor plugin.<br />\n2. Upgrade to WordPress 5.0.<br />\n3. After January 17, review the results of the WPCampus accessibility audit.</p>\n<p>The results of the WPCampus audit will give everyone a good starting point for deciding what comes next.</p></blockquote>\n<p>November is setting up to be a very interesting time in the WordPress world.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","slug":"plugins"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","slug":"security"},{"id":"7b9f7495-e01f-52fb-8211-386c845eb899","wordpress_id":82,"count":4,"name":"Themes","description":"","slug":"themes"}],"wpc_seo":{"title":"","meta":{"description":"Vulnerable Plugins There were eight disclosures over the last two weeks, with two issues unfixed, one unknown.
