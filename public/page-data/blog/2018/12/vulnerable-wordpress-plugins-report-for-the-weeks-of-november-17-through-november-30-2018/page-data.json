First, RIPS Technologies <a href=\"https://blog.ripstech.com/2018/phpbb3-phar-deserialization-to-remote-code-execution/\">revealed details</a> behind a Remote Code Execution vulnerability via phar deserialization in <a href=\"https://www.phpbb.com/\">phpBB</a>, version 3.2.3 and earlier. phpBB has<a href=\"https://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=14&amp;t=2492206\"> released v3.2.4</a> which fixes the vulnerability. Next, it was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/26/the-us-postal-service-exposed-data-of-60-million-users/\">revealed</a> the US Postal Service had exposed data from 60 million of its customers via a broken API.  Not to be outdone, Marriott <a href=\"https://marriott.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/marriott-announces-starwood-guest-reservation-database-security\">revealed</a> that some 500 million customers records from its Starwood properties had been breached in September of this year.  Researchers at Tenable <a href=\"https://www.tenable.com/blog/tenable-research-advisory-zoom-unauthorized-command-execution-cve-2018-15715\">revealed</a> that a vulnerability in Zoom&#8217;s desktop conference application could allow an attacker to spoof messages, hijack screen controls and kick other attendees out of meetings.  Zoom has <a href=\"https://zoom.us/download\">released an update</a> that corrects the vulnerability.  Last, it was <a href=\"https://github.com/dominictarr/event-stream/issues/116\">revealed</a> that a popular npm package, <a href=\"https://github.com/dominictarr/event-stream\">event-stream</a>, had had crypto-stealing code injected into it back in September.</p>\n<p>While on break last week, I spent some checking out some new tools. <a href=\"https://xssfuzzer.com/\">XSS Fuzzer</a> is a Cross-Site Scripting fuzzing utility written in html, css, and javascript. <a href=\"https://somdev.me/XSStrike/\">XSStrike</a> is a Cross Site Scripting detection suite (and a <a href=\"https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/discover-xss-security-flaws-by-fuzzing-with-burp-suite-wfuzz-xsstrike-0189971/\">great article</a> on using <a href=\"https://portswigger.net/burp\">Burp Suite</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/xmendez/wfuzz\">WFuzz</a>, and XSStrike to find XSS vulnerabilities in applications). <a href=\"https://github.com/raz-varren/xsshell\">XSShell</a>, a cross-site scripting reverse shell (which reminds me a little bit of the <a href=\"https://xenotix.in/\">Xenotix XSS Exploit Framework</a>).  Last is a new static-analysis tool for PHP, <a href=\"https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan\">PHPStan</a> (hat-tip to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidneedham\">David Needham</a> for telling me about it).</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","slug":"plugins"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","slug":"security"}],"wpc_seo":{"title":"","meta":{"description":"Vulnerable Plugins There were four disclosures over the last two weeks, with one issue unfixed.
