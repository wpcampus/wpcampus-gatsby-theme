However, right as I was writing this post, <a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/\">WordFence</a> released a <a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2019/01/wordpress-sites-compromised-via-zero-day-vulnerabilities-in-total-donations-plugin/\">post detailing multiple vulnerabilities</a> in the plugin <strong>Total Donations</strong> that can lead to a complete site take-over. The plugin appears to be abandoned so there is a high chance it will not be fixed. If you are using this plugin, <strong>you are encouraged to delete it immediately</strong>.</p>\n<p><a class=\"button expand\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mpZYo2xz-oxjz4tyiA9Up_VtRZGV6xigdy-7ZZfPUVQ/edit?usp=sharing\">View this week&#8217;s vulnerable plugins list.</a></p>\n<h2>Other WordPress Security News</h2>\n<p>Beta 2 of WordPress 5.1 was released today, with the final version <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-1/\">scheduled</a> for release on February 21st.  5.1 <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/dev-notes+5-1/\">brings a number of interesting features</a>, but <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/01/14/php-site-health-mechanisms-in-5-1/\">one in particular</a> is causing some controversy.  5.1 will introduce a collection of PHP Site Health mechanisms to encourage and aid site owners in upgrading their installed version of PHP.  One specific feature of the site health has been dubbed White-Screen-of-Death (WSOD) protection.  The idea is that if a plugin or theme causes a fatal error, WordPress will catch the error, and suspend the offending code so that an administrator can still log into the backend to update or remove the offending code. While a good idea in theory, several have <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/concerns-raised-about-wordpress-new-white-screen-of-death-protection-feature/\">pointed</a> <a href=\"https://medium.com/websec/wordpress-serve-happy-ffd93c94f5ac\">out</a> that this feature could be abused to disable non-offending plugins, thereby bypassing security functionality.  From the make post it appears that this functionality will be enabled by default when 5.1 drops.  A new configuration option ( <code>WP_DISABLE_FATAL_ERROR_HANDLER</code> ) is available to disable this feature.  Given its possibility for abuse, I would encourage you to disable this feature except when updating/upgrading your site.</p>\n<h2>Other Security News</h2>\n<p>If you use PEAR&#8217;s package manager (go-pear.phar), and have downloaded it from the PEAR site any time over the last two months, it is <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2019/01/php-pear-hacked.html\">possible your copy is tainted</a>.  Maintainers at the PEAR repository took down the official PEAR website an then <a href=\"http://blog.pear.php.net/\">announced</a> the PEAR website had been compromised.  A clean version is available on the PEAR github site. You are encouraged to checksum your version with the clean version, or replace your copy with the known-clean version and then scan your systems.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll be joining <a href=\"https://pantheon.io/\">Pantheon</a> next Thursday (the 31st) at 12:00pm CST to discuss WordPress application security in a higher education setting.  <a href=\"https://pantheon.io/resources/january-couch-coding\">Registration is now open.</a></p>\n<h2>Other News</h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, my webinar with Pantheon just happens to be on the at the exact same day as <a href=\"https://online.dev5290.wpcampus.org/schedule/\">WPCampus Online 2019</a>, and at the exact same time as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bamadesigner\">Rachel</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BrianDeConinck\">Brian&#8217;s</a> report on the <a href=\"https://online.dev5290.wpcampus.org/schedule/wpcampus-gutenberg-accessibility-audit/\">WPCampus Gutenberg Accessibility Audit report</a>.  I strongly encourage everyone to take advantage of this free online conference as it features some incredible speakers covering a wide-range of topics (don&#8217;t miss <a href=\"https://twitter.com/arrowood\">Adam Arrowood</a>&#8216;s presentation <a href=\"https://online.dev5290.wpcampus.org/schedule/what-to-expect-when-youre-expecting-to-be-hacked-wordpress-edition/\"><em>What to expect when you’re expecting to be hacked: WordPress edition</em></a>). And while I would love to have all of you attend my webinar, the Gutenberg Accessibility audit is <em>extremely</em> important to not only higher education, but to everyone who uses WordPress. Don&#8217;t miss it.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","slug":"plugins"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","slug":"security"}],"wpc_seo":{"title":"","meta":{"description":"Vulnerable Plugins Three disclosures since last week, with all issues fixed.
