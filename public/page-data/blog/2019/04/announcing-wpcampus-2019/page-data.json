We’d love talks on dev, design, content, strategy, management, being human and whatever else you find valuable to make the web, and higher education, a better place.</p>\n<p>If you use WordPress in higher ed, we’d love for you to share your work (and brains) with our community. If you need topic inspiration, we have provided a few ideas on our call for speakers.</p>\n<p><a class=\"button primary expand bigger\" href=\"https://2019.dev5290.wpcampus.org/call-for-speakers/application/\">Apply to speak at WPCampus 2019</a><br />\n<a class=\"button light-gray expand\" href=\"https://2019.dev5290.wpcampus.org/\">Learn more about WPCampus 2019</a></p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"95dfb001-f6cc-50d2-912e-fd2b865d62f5","wordpress_id":214,"count":13,"name":"WPCampus 2019","description":"","slug":"wpcampus-2019"}],"wpc_seo":{"title":"","meta":{"description":"We’re excited to officially announce WPCampus 2019!
