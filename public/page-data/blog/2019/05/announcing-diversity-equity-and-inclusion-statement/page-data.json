As many of you know, accessibility is a major focus for our initiatives and events. We believe that accessibility can only be achieved through a culture that supports inclusion of all types of members, and efforts to provide equity in experience for those members.</p>\n<p>Our Diversity &amp; Inclusion group is proud to be able to put words to our strong feelings and provide an official focus to this critically important issue. We hope you&#8217;ll take a moment to read through it and reflect on how you can implement these principals in your experiences with WPCampus, and in your daily life.</p>\n<p><a class=\"button blue larger expand\" href=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/diversity\">View our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion statement</a></p>\n<p>The statement and <a href=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/code-of-conduct/\">Code of Conduct</a> will be linked &#8211; both online and organizationally.
