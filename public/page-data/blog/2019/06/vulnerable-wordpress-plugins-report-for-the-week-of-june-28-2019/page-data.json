In addition, there is a Cross-Site Request Forgery to Remote Code Execution vulnerability in  <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-logic/\">Widget Logic</a> (fixed as of version 5.10.2), and a Cross-Site Request Forgery to Settings Update vulnerability in the same plugin that is unfixed as of this posting.  Last, an Unauthorized Settings Update (fix available) in Block WP Login that allows an attacker to disable the protection offered by the plugin.</p>\n<p><a class=\"button expand\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18J04v1NmfmS4gTwV6mlFbQOKIJkShsPeiVzOjFF0DIU/edit?usp=sharing\">View this week&#8217;s vulnerable plugins list.</a></p>\n<h2>Other Security News</h2>\n<p>Wanted to just quickly mention that <a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com\">Wordfence</a> has a <a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2019/06/podcast-episode-26-how-hackers-find-vulnerabilities-in-wordpress-with-ryan-dewhurst/\">great interview</a> with <a href=\"https://dewhurstsecurity.com/\">Ryan Dewurst</a> who has contributed greatly to the <a href=\"https://wpscan.org/\">wpscan</a> tool, as well as being the maintainer of the <a href=\"https://wpvulndb.com/\">wpvulndb.com</a> database.  Definitely check it out.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","slug":"plugins"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","slug":"security"}],"wpc_seo":{"title":"","meta":{"description":"Vulnerable Plugins There are thirty four issues this week, with four unfixed.  The most critical this week is an unfixed Arbitrary Password Reset vulnerability with the Ultimate Members plugin.  Since...","robots":[]}}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"siteName":"WPCampus: Where WordPress meets higher education"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"a131f41e-65b4-5b91-af7a-471a461c8c5c","wpc_protected":null,"next":{"id":"bdc46a92-1ccb-54b7-90da-f8bdc978eda8","wordpress_id":35948,"slug":"donate-and-help-wpcampus-support-digital-inclusion","path":"/blog/2019/06/donate-and-help-wpcampus-support-digital-inclusion/","title":"Donate and help WPCampus support digital inclusion","date":"2019-06-27T14:46:42.000Z","wpc_protected":null},"previous":{"id":"5c919ef6-94d8-58fe-98d1-b68ddc54a833","wordpress_id":36029,"slug":"vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-for-the-week-of-july-5-2019","path":"/blog/2019/07/vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-for-the-week-of-july-5-2019/","title":"Vulnerable WordPress Plugins Report for the Week of July 5, 2019","date":"2019-07-05T19:45:12.000Z","wpc_protected":null},"crumbs":{"crumb":{"path":"/blog/2019/06/vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-for-the-week-of-june-28-2019/","text":"Vulnerable WordPress Plugins Report for the Week of June 28, 2019"},"parent_element":{"crumb":{"path":"/blog/","text":"Community Blog"}}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2186475492"]}
