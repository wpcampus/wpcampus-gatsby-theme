The event will cover a variety of topics, all focused on the growth of Higher Education, Accessibility, WordPress, and its people.</p>\n<h2>A new schedule</h2>\n<p>In the past, our event has taken place Thursday through Saturday, but we listened to your feedback and moved our program to Wednesday through Friday.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re excited about this change and what it means for the event. The new program will give in-person attendees more time to visit New Orleans over the weekend before they return home.</p>\n<p>We also noticed a drop off of live stream viewers on Saturday so we hope this change will allow our virtual attendees to enjoy the entire program during their workday.</p>\n<h2>An amazing city</h2>\n<p>New Orleans is a beautiful and lively city that we can&#8217;t wait to explore it with our community. We&#8217;re on the lookout for social and networking events. Our Slack is already filled with discussions of cooking classes, historic tours, and the best places to eat.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve never been to New Orleans, we can&#8217;t recommend it enough. We hope you can join us and experience the fun for yourself.</p>\n<h2>What to expect</h2>\n<p>While the format of our event is similar to a WordCamp, our entire program is focused on Higher Education and Accessibility, which allows for a richer and more fine-tuned experience for our attendees.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll never want to miss a session because they&#8217;re tailored just for you, a web professional who builds WordPress websites for Higher Education. Take advantage of face-to-face discussions with fellow attendees who also know what it’s like to build websites in Higher Ed.</p>\n<p>Share with, learn from, and be inspired by, your peers.</p>\n<p>The schedule isn’t finalized but you can <a href=\"https://2020.dev5290.wpcampus.org/schedule/\">visit the schedule page</a> to know what to expect, especially for those who will be joining us for the first time in New Orleans.</p>\n<p>For those who can’t make the trip, we expect to continue our tradition of live streaming our sessions.</p>\n<p>To learn more about the content we provide, you can access recordings from past events in the <a href=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/library/\">WPCampus Learning Library</a> or on the <a href=\"https://2019.dev5290.wpcampus.org/schedule/\">WPCampus 2019 website</a>.</p>\n<h2>On-campus lodging</h2>\n<p>We’re excited to offer on-campus housing again for this year’s event, which really helps to keep travel costs low. We’ll post information as soon as its available.</p>\n<h2>Become a speaker</h2>\n<p>If you’d like to speak at the event, be on the lookout for our call for proposals!</p>\n<p>Accepted speakers receive free admission and hordes of gratefulness and admiration for your investment in Higher Education. Also, swag.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://2020.dev5290.wpcampus.org/speakers/\">Visit our speakers page</a> to learn about topic ideas, session formats, and more.</p>\n<h2>Become a sponsor</h2>\n<p>Your support helps provide an affordable experience for our members and gives you access to a large number of Higher Education institutions from across North America and Europe.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in sponsoring our event, please let us know by filling out <a href=\"https://2020.dev5290.wpcampus.org/sponsors/#interest\">our sponsor interest form</a>. We will be in touch with more information.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"b7cb3630-c920-59ec-9cb7-fb8c158a1840","wordpress_id":245,"count":9,"name":"WPCampus 2020","description":"","slug":"wpcampus-2020"}],"wpc_seo":{"title":"","meta":{"description":"The WPCampus community is excited to announce the dates for our 2020 in-person conference.
