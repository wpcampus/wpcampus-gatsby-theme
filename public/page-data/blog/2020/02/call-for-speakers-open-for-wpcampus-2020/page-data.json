If you use WordPress in higher ed, we’d love for you to share your work (and brains) with our community. <strong>Our call for speakers is not limited to those who work in higher ed as you do not have to be in higher education to bring value to our community.</strong></p>\n<p>If you’re having trouble finding inspiration or fleshing out ideas, start by checking out our <a href=\"https://wpcampus.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6d71860d429d3461309568b92&amp;id=969c2fdf57&amp;e=f17142f289\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Speaker Training videos</a>.
