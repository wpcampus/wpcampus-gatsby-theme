One more reason to start that brainstorming early!</p>\n<h2>Session Formats</h2>\n<p>Over the years, we&#8217;ve continued to experiment with our program and aim to provide a variety of formats:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>General lecture sessions\n<ul>\n<li>45 minute lectures on various topics with 1-2 presenters.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Panel discussions\n<ul>\n<li>45 minute discussion on a specific topic with a facilitator and a panel of experts.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Group discussions\n<ul>\n<li>45 minute group discussions on a specific topic.</li>\n<li>The discussion is had among all in attendance and led by a facilitator.</li>\n<li>The facilitator is selected by the planning committee but the community selects the topics.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Hands-on workshops\n<ul>\n<li>A few 2-4 hour hands-on workshop time slots are available.</li>\n<li>Workshops will be held a day early.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Lightning talks\n<ul>\n<li>A 10-15 minute presentation for a quick overview of a specific topic.</li>\n<li>Our lightning talks are viewed by all attendees.
