We aim to expand upon our previous online events to provide more options for interaction and learning within a virtual space.</p>\n<p>Tulane University IT in New Orleans has agreed to continue to be our in-person venue sponsor for WPCampus 2021 and is working with us to book new dates.</p>\n<p>The following dates are being considered for WPCampus 2021:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>July 14-16, 2021 (Wed-Fri)</li>\n<li>July 21-23, 2021 (Wed-Fri)</li>\n<li>July 28-30, 2021 (Wed-Fri)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"wpc-callout\"><a class=\"button\" href=\"http://eepurl.com/dukZvP\">Subscribe to our newsletter</a> for all WPCampus 2020 Online and WPCampus 2021 updates.</div>\n<p>While WPCampus 2020 is still four months away, the effects of COVID-19 are rapidly evolving, and the emotional and physical health of our members is our primary concern. We also strive to be positive global citizens. Doing our part to stop the spread of the virus and minimize stress is vital.</p>\n<p>Many of our members also <a href=\"#researchTravel\">reported that travel at their organization has been suspended</a>. Since most attendees have to travel for our event, we believe it is in everyone’s best interest to postpone the event. We’ll use the remaining four months to organize an accessible online conference.</p>\n<h2>How to attend the online event</h2>\n<p>Attending WPCampus 2020 Online will be as simple as visiting the <a href=\"https://2020.dev5290.wpcampus.org/\">WPCampus 2020 online website</a>.</p>\n<p>Registration will be required to access the online event. Registration will be a simple online form that will go online before the event and will remain open throughout the event. <a href=\"http://eepurl.com/dukZvP\">Subscribe to our newsletter</a> to be notified when registration opens.</p>\n<p>We will provide live captioning for all conference programming.</p>\n<h2>Looking for speakers</h2>\n<p>We have re-opened our <a href=\"https://2020.dev5290.wpcampus.org/speakers/application/\">call for speakers</a> to allow everyone an opportunity to present virtually. Speakers who have already submitted an application do not need to re-submit.</p>\n<p><strong>The call for speakers will remain open until April 30.</strong> Selected presenters will be notified by May 15.</p>\n<h2>Looking for sponsorship</h2>\n<p>We are working to redefine our sponsor packages for WPCampus 2020 Online and are seeking sponsors to help bring this event to life. We will need funds for captioning and other technical requirements.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in a sponsorship, please <a href=\"https://2020.dev5290.wpcampus.org/sponsors/#interest\">fill out our sponsor interest form</a>. Be sure to include any questions or ideas you might have related to sponsor participation and perks.</p>\n<h2>Sharing updates on organizing an online event</h2>\n<p>You may have noticed that the <a href=\"https://2020.dev5290.wpcampus.org/\">WPCampus 2020 Online website</a> is a little bare.</p>\n<p>As part of our planning, the WPCampus community is going to re-design the WPCampus 2020 Online website. The fun will begin in April after we launch the re-design of <a href=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org\">the main WPCampus website</a>.</p>\n<p>As we redesign the website, we are going to blog about the process, which will include our research and insight into the technical specifics needed to host an online conference.</p>\n<div class=\"wpc-callout\"><a class=\"button\" href=\"http://eepurl.com/dOd-Q9\">Subscribe to to our blog updates</a> to follow along with the WPCampus 2020 Online re-design.</div>\n<h2 id=\"research\">Sharing our research</h2>\n<p>Last week the planning team sent out a survey to ask our members for more information to drive this decision.
