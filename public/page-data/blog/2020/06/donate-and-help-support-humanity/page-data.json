Swag is fun, but it can be wasteful. We choose to use those funds to help people in and outside of our community.</p>\n<p>Traditionally, we sponsor a fundraising campaign to support a local organization. For WPCampus 2019, <a href=\"https://www.dev5290.wpcampus.org/blog/2019/06/donate-and-help-wpcampus-support-digital-inclusion/\">we raised $3,000 for Free Geek in Portland, Oregon</a>. This year we have decided to recognize and support the vital #BlackLivesMatter movement, technology education, and those struggling with COVID-19.</p>\n<h2>We are matching donations</h2>\n<p>For this year&#8217;s fundraising efforts, we have chosen five organizations and will <strong>match up to USD $3,000 in donations</strong> to these selected organizations. To participate: <a href=\"https://2020.dev5290.wpcampus.org/donate/#eligibility\">learn about eligibility</a> and <a href=\"https://2020.dev5290.wpcampus.org/donate/#submit\">submit your donation</a>. We will accept submissions until July 31, 2020, or when we&#8217;ve met our $3,000 match limit.</p>\n<p><a class=\"wpc-button wpc-button--larger wpc-button--primary wpc-button--center wpc-button--expand\" href=\"https://2020.dev5290.wpcampus.org/donate/#submit\">Submit your donation</a></p>\n<h2>Organizations to support</h2>\n<p><strong>WPCampus stands with the Black community against racism, violence, and hate,</strong> which is why we&#8217;ve chosen several organizations dedicated to the #BlackLivesMatter human rights movement and Black Girls Code, who focus on providing technology education for African-American youth. We are also proud to support Feeding America, which supports the needs of individuals struggling with food insecurity. The Feeding America COVID-19 Response Fund is providing relief for those facing hunger in these uncertain times.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://blacklivesmatter.com/\">Black Lives Matter</a></h3>\n<p>Black Lives Matter is committed to fighting against the injustice black people face around the globe.

Their Racial Justice Program aims to preserve and extend constitutionally guaranteed rights to people who have historically been denied their rights on the basis of race.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.naacpldf.org/\">NAACP Legal Defense Fund</a></h3>\n<p>The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund is America’s premier legal organization fighting for racial justice. Through litigation, advocacy, and public education, LDF seeks structural changes to expand democracy, eliminate disparities, and achieve racial justice in a society that fulfills the promise of equality for all Americans.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.blackgirlscode.com/\">Black Girls Code</a></h3>\n<p>Black Girls Code is a not-for-profit organization that focuses on providing technology education for African-American girls.
