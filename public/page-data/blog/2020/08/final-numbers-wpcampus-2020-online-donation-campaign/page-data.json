For WPCampus 2019, <a href=\"https://www.dev5290.wpcampus.org/blog/2019/06/donate-and-help-wpcampus-support-digital-inclusion/\">we raised $3,000 for Free Geek in Portland, Oregon</a>.</p>\n<p>For <a href=\"https://2020.dev5290.wpcampus.org\">WPCampus 2020 Online</a>, we decided to recognize and support the vital #BlackLivesMatter movement and those struggling with COVID-19. We chose five organizations and asked community members and conference attendees to <a href=\"https://2020.dev5290.wpcampus.org/donate/\" aria-label=\"submit matching donations for WPCampus 2020 online\">submit matching donations</a>.</p>\n<p>With a goal of $3,000 in matched donations, we received $2,340 in submissions. Among our trivia and door prize winners, ten elected to donate their winnings towards a selected organization. These donations increased the total amount by $200. We divided the remaining $460 (towards our $3,000 goal) among the organizations.</p>\n<p>While we didn&#8217;t quite reach our goal of $3,000 in matched donations, the WPCampus organization donated $3,000 and overall helped to raise $5,340. We consider the campaign a great success!</p>\n<p>Here are the numbers donated to each organization. We invite you to <a href=\"https://2020.dev5290.wpcampus.org/donate/\">learn more about each organization</a> and continue to contribute to their cause.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Black Girls Code:</strong> $507 from WPCampus, $882 overall</li>\n<li><strong>Black Lives Matter:</strong> $817 from WPCampus, $1502 overall</li>\n<li><strong>Feeding America:</strong> $327 from WPCampus, $522 overall</li>\n<li><strong>NAACP Legal Defense Fund:</strong> $1,062 from WPCampus. $2,012 overall</li>\n<li><strong>The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU):</strong> $287 from WPCampus, $422 overall</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thank you to all who donated. WPCampus is a community before its a conference. We are humans before we are web professionals. One of our organizational pillars will always be to do what we can to support and care for each other.</p>\n<p>As a side note: we are publishing session recordings from the conference as soon as they are processed. The first one available is an excellent presentation from Joe Dolson: &#8220;Update on the Gutenberg accessibility audit”: <a href=\"https://2020.dev5290.wpcampus.org/schedule/update-on-gutenberg-accessibility-audit/#video\">https://2020.dev5290.wpcampus.org/schedule/update-on-gutenberg-accessibility-audit/#video</a></p>\n<p>Check the <a href=\"https://2020.dev5290.wpcampus.org/schedule/\">WPCampus 2020 schedule</a> often for new recordings. We will publish a blog post when the process is complete.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"e3b4720f-aaa2-5e57-84d4-d6734cd5b5c5","wordpress_id":237,"count":10,"name":"Conference","description":"","slug":"conference"},{"id":"b7cb3630-c920-59ec-9cb7-fb8c158a1840","wordpress_id":245,"count":9,"name":"WPCampus 2020","description":"","slug":"wpcampus-2020"}],"wpc_seo":{"title":"","meta":{"description":"One of our WPCampus traditions is to use the “previously allocated to swag” portion of our event income to support a nonprofit organization.
