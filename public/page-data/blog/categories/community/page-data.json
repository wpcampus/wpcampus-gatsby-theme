Swag is fun, but it can be wasteful. We choose to use those funds to help people in and outside of our community.</p>\n<p>Traditionally, we sponsor a fundraising campaign to support a local organization. For WPCampus 2019, <a href=\"https://www.dev5290.wpcampus.org/blog/2019/06/donate-and-help-wpcampus-support-digital-inclusion/\">we raised $3,000 for Free Geek in Portland, Oregon</a>. This year we have decided to recognize and support the vital #BlackLivesMatter movement, technology education, and those struggling with COVID-19.</p>\n<h2>We are matching donations</h2>\n<p>For this year&#8217;s fundraising efforts, we have chosen five organizations and will <strong>match up to USD $3,000 in donations</strong> to these selected organizations.

We are also proud to support Feeding America, which supports the needs of individuals struggling with food insecurity. The Feeding America COVID-19 Response Fund is providing relief for those facing hunger in these uncertain times.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://blacklivesmatter.com/\">Black Lives Matter</a></h3>\n<p>Black Lives Matter is committed to fighting against the injustice black people face around the globe. They continue to advocate against the violence and killing of black people.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/\">The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)</a></h3>\n<p>The ACLU is a nationwide nonprofit that operates in all 50 states and provides legal assistance wherever civil liberties are at risk. Their Racial Justice Program aims to preserve and extend constitutionally guaranteed rights to people who have historically been denied their rights on the basis of race.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.naacpldf.org/\">NAACP Legal Defense Fund</a></h3>\n<p>The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund is America’s premier legal organization fighting for racial justice. Through litigation, advocacy, and public education, LDF seeks structural changes to expand democracy, eliminate disparities, and achieve racial justice in a society that fulfills the promise of equality for all Americans.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.blackgirlscode.com/\">Black Girls Code</a></h3>\n<p>Black Girls Code is a not-for-profit organization that focuses on providing technology education for African-American girls. Their vision is to provide African-American youth with the skills to occupy some of the 1.4 million computing job openings expected to be available in the U.S. by 2020 and to train 1 million girls by 2040.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.feedingamerica.org/\">Feeding America</a></h3>\n<p>The Feeding America network is the nation’s largest domestic hunger-relief organization and has long supported food banks.
