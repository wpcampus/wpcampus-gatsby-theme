Swag is a joy to give out (and have a bit of WPCampus flair to take home) but there has always been concern over financial and product waste.</p>\n<p>As a small, non-profit organization, we also want to ensure our limited budget goes toward supporting what&#8217;s truly important to our organization&#8217;s <a href=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/about/\">mission and vision</a>.</p>\n<h2>Help us replace swag with digital inclusion</h2>\n<p>This year, our organizing team is excited to announce that, in lieu of spending money on swag, we will donate those funds to <a href=\"https://www.freegeek.org/\">Free Geek</a>, a non-profit organization in the Portland metro area that focuses on creating digital equity through environmental sustainability.</p>\n<p>We feel that supporting such an important cause is more worthwhile than buying more &#8220;stuff&#8221; and we hope you&#8217;ll join in to increase our donation.</p>\n<h2>Help us support Free Geek</h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-35954\" src=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/wp-content/uploads/free-geek_logo.png\" alt=\"Free Geek logo\" width=\"275\" height=\"275\" />Whether or not you&#8217;ll be joining us in Portland, we invite you to join our campaign to <a href=\"https://secure.givelively.org/donate/free-geek/wpcampus-support-digital-inclusion\">raise $3,000 for the Free Geek organization</a>.</p>\n<p>For nineteen years, <a href=\"http://www.freegeek.org/\">Free Geek</a> has been committed to digital equity for all, regardless of socioeconomic status, ethnicity, age, gender, ability, or any other factor. It is a right, not a privilege, and in the 21st century, it is a need as basic as telephones or transportation.</p>\n<p>To fulfill their mission, Free Geek provides several digital inclusion programs, building upon their commitment to create a community that empowers people.</p>\n<p>Free Geek&#8217;s vision is to include everyone in our digital future, and their digital inclusion programs work to put technology in the hands of the people that need it the most, and provide digital literacy training to those who seek it.</p>\n<p><a class=\"button expand larger\" href=\"https://secure.givelively.org/donate/free-geek/wpcampus-support-digital-inclusion\">Donate now to support Free Geek</a></p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"62dc2d31-a706-5fbb-9147-ee2946d25293","wordpress_id":233,"count":3,"name":"Diversity and Inclusion","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/diversity-inclusion/"},{"id":"95dfb001-f6cc-50d2-912e-fd2b865d62f5","wordpress_id":214,"count":13,"name":"WPCampus 2019","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/wpcampus-2019/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"87f8ca51-0f81-51dc-bab0-0d27189ee026","wordpress_id":35545,"slug":"announcing-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-statement","path":"/blog/2019/05/announcing-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-statement/","author":[{"id":"84e067d1-9447-50ad-b399-c11cd4b6b08b","path":"ncsumarit","display_name":"Jen Riehle McFarland","email":"jmriehle@ncsu.edu","twitter":"ncsumarit","website":"https://design.oit.ncsu.edu/","company":"NC State University","company_position":"Web Services Coordinator","bio":"Jen is a member of the Design &amp; Web Services team in NC State's central IT unit.
