However, I fully empathize with universities/organizations that have to stay with an older version due to internal policies or change management policies. This is especially true after the release of version 5.0.0 with Gutenberg.  If you use an older version, or have policies in place where you can&#8217;t immediately update to the latest major version of WordPress as soon as it is released, then <strong>I strongly encourage you to weigh in over on the policy proposal page</strong> and have your voice heard.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/plugins/"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/security/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"ef66243a-da66-5e56-9d63-f3416e667a7f","wordpress_id":36403,"slug":"vulnerable-plugins-report-for-the-week-of-august-2nd-2019","path":"/blog/2019/08/vulnerable-plugins-report-for-the-week-of-august-2nd-2019/","author":[{"id":"7f4ed30b-8e00-5331-bfb2-ed54dc0fcc41","path":"pgogy","display_name":"Pat Lockley","email":"Info@pgogywebstuff.com","twitter":"Pgogy","website":"https://pgogywebstuff.com","company":"Pgogy webstuff","company_position":"Owner","bio":"Academic technologist and pedagogic outfitter.

While a good idea in theory, several have <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/concerns-raised-about-wordpress-new-white-screen-of-death-protection-feature/\">pointed</a> <a href=\"https://medium.com/websec/wordpress-serve-happy-ffd93c94f5ac\">out</a> that this feature could be abused to disable non-offending plugins, thereby bypassing security functionality.  From the make post it appears that this functionality will be enabled by default when 5.1 drops.  A new configuration option ( <code>WP_DISABLE_FATAL_ERROR_HANDLER</code> ) is available to disable this feature.  Given its possibility for abuse, I would encourage you to disable this feature except when updating/upgrading your site.</p>\n<h2>Other Security News</h2>\n<p>If you use PEAR&#8217;s package manager (go-pear.phar), and have downloaded it from the PEAR site any time over the last two months, it is <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2019/01/php-pear-hacked.html\">possible your copy is tainted</a>.  Maintainers at the PEAR repository took down the official PEAR website an then <a href=\"http://blog.pear.php.net/\">announced</a> the PEAR website had been compromised.  A clean version is available on the PEAR github site.

Instead, RC1 will now be released on the 19th.  While I would personally like to see this pushed back even further (until next year), this at least gets us past Thanksgiving, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday.</p>\n<p>A second bit of good news came out earlier this week when the core team <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/11/07/classic-editor-plugin-support-window/\">announced</a> they will support the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/\">Classic Editor plugin</a> until December 31, 2021.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Classic Editor plugin will be officially supported until <strong>December 31, 2021</strong>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>While I applaud the core team for committing to long-term support of the Classic Editor plugin, it still doesn&#8217;t address the continued accessibility issues with Gutenberg. If Gutenberg is the future, then we need to make sure it is accessible to <em>everyone</em>. To aid organizations (Higher Education in particular) in the evaluation of adopting Gutenberg, WPCampus is now <a href=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/2018/10/gutenberg-a11y-audit-rfp/\">accepting proposals</a> from accessibility testing vendors to audit the Gutenberg editor. Results from the audit will be published to the WPCampus site.  The deadline for proposal submission is November 14. If you currently work with an accessibility testing vendor, we would greatly appreciate you letting them know of our RFP.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/plugins/"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/security/"},{"id":"7b9f7495-e01f-52fb-8211-386c845eb899","wordpress_id":82,"count":4,"name":"Themes","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/themes/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"eacde366-7114-5a6e-af31-992ad3cbd4a0","wordpress_id":30257,"slug":"vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-for-the-weeks-of-october-20-through-november-2-2018","path":"/blog/2018/11/vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-for-the-weeks-of-october-20-through-november-2-2018/","author":[{"id":"5be72c28-6949-53f8-b212-3feb5a9983de","path":"gilzow","display_name":"Paul Gilzow","email":"gilzowp@missouri.edu","twitter":"gilzow","website":"http://missouri.edu/","company":"University of Missouri","company_position":"Programmer Analyst","bio":"Web application security and accessibility evangelist.

The one change from then is the WPCampus community has put out an <a href=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/2018/10/gutenberg-a11y-audit-rfp/\">RFP for an accessibility audit on Gutenberg</a>, so I would suggest <a href=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/get-involved/\">joining the WPCampus slack workspace</a> to stay up-to-date as the audit progresses and to see the results. From there, you&#8217;ll have a much better idea as to whether or not you can implement Gutenberg on your campus.</p>\n<p>And I&#8217;m not the only one making this suggestion.

The plugin includes code that allows for unauthenticated file uploads and did not include code in the upload process to verify user authorization to perform the upload.  The package does include an .htaccess file to force the download of any uploaded file; however, this assumes the site is using Apache for the web server, and that Apache is set up to follow user-land htaccess files.  Unfortunately, the codebase has over 7000 forks and has been bundled into numerous other packages.  While a fix has been released, it will take some time, if ever, to get the updated code into all the different packages where it has been included. We&#8217;ll most likely see this vulnerability crop up again as researchers and threat agents discover its use in other packages.</p>\n<p>The 5.X branch of PHP will officially reach end-of-life for security updates as of December 31 of this year.  Unfortunately, according to w3techs.com, version 5.X of PHP makes up 78.1% of all php websites, with 78.9% of all sites tracked using PHP. This means that by the end of the year, 60% of all sites online will be running an unsupported version of PHP.  If your institution is still on 5.X begin engaging with your System Administrators to begin plans to upgrade as soon as possible. As an added bonus, <a href=\"https://kinsta.com/blog/php-7-hhvm-benchmarks/\">PHP7.X is significantly faster than PHP5.X</a>. Hopefully this final death knell of PHP5.X will push WordPress core to <em>finally</em> update the minimum PHP version to something more current.</p>\n<h2>Other News</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://2018.highedweb.org/\">HighEdWeb 2018</a> starts this weekend.   I sincerely hope that I&#8217;ll be seeing many of you there.

This means the 4.9.9 release has been shelved unless the core team is unable to release 5.0 before the end of the year:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8230;the intention is to have 5.0 out (including some small fixes to ensure compatibility) before PHP 7.3 is released. If 5.0 delays significantly, then there will be a 4.9.9 release with just the PHP 7.3 compatibility fixes.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In addition, from the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/10/04/dev-chat-summary-october-3rd-5-0-week-1/\">October 3rd Dev Chat</a>, Matt Mullenweg indicated that he plans to continue releasing minor updates that includes new features/updates:</p>\n<blockquote><p>@matt: open to having 5.0.x releases that are like the 4.9.x releases that bring in some larger updates or improvements we push off (e.g., servehappy the WordPress PHP education initiative)</p></blockquote>\n<p>This leaves those of us who are under strict change management policies in a bit of a bind.  It will very challenging to introduce Gutenberg to a large audience in an enterprise setting in six short weeks. You can certainly upgrade to 5.0 and install the classic editor but given Matt&#8217;s statement above, it&#8217;s very possible that additional Gutenberg-related features will be pushed out as minor updates (which fall under the default auto-update setting).  Several have mentioned staying at 4.9.8 if you aren&#8217;t ready to upgrade. However, many of us in Higher Education are required to stay on current supported branches of a product.  <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Supported_Versions\">WordPress&#8217; support policy</a> states:</p>\n<blockquote><p>WordPress will be backported security updates when possible, but there are no guarantee and no timeframe for older releases. There are no fixed period of support nor Long Term Support (LTS) version such as Ubuntu&#8217;s. None of these are safe to use, except the latest series, which is actively maintained.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Which means to be compliant, we <em>have</em> to upgrade to 5.0 or begin working on being granted an exception to the policy. For now, my suggestion would be to upgrade when it is released, install the classic editor plugin and <em>disable</em> auto-updates to prevent new, unverified features from being introduced into your system.  This means <strong>you will need to </strong><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">subscribe</a><strong> to the core announcements</strong> so that you can apply any security-related updates, while simultaneously trying to get everyone in your organization up-to-speed on the new interface as quickly as possible.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/plugins/"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/security/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"61d0856f-9cb4-50af-8d86-f2f042ad0ebc","wordpress_id":29411,"slug":"vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-for-the-week-of-september-28-2018","path":"/blog/2018/09/vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-for-the-week-of-september-28-2018/","author":[{"id":"5be72c28-6949-53f8-b212-3feb5a9983de","path":"gilzow","display_name":"Paul Gilzow","email":"gilzowp@missouri.edu","twitter":"gilzow","website":"http://missouri.edu/","company":"University of Missouri","company_position":"Programmer Analyst","bio":"Web application security and accessibility evangelist.

The updated report from Talos includes additional routers that are being targeted by the malware, that the malware includes the ability to inject malicious code into the web traffic as it passes through the device, and the ability to brick the device. While rebooting the device helps disrupt the malware, it does not remove it, and there is no easy way to tell if a router has been infected. It&#8217;s important to note though that just because your router might be on Talos&#8217; list that doesn&#8217;t mean your router is infected.  It just means your router is capable of running the malware once infected.  The actual infection has to happen through some other vulnerability, many of which have already been patched by the manufacturer. The problem lies in that most people <em>don&#8217;t</em> patch their home routers, and that detecting an infected router is difficult.  If you have been religiously updating your router, then you are probably safe.  For everyone else, or if you&#8217;re just paranoid, the only safe, reliable way to ensure you&#8217;re not affected is to factory reset the router and then apply all patches/upgrades.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/plugins/"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/security/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"87dd2c6d-84d1-5185-8b38-aa61b5a2d86b","wordpress_id":25060,"slug":"vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-for-the-week-of-june-1-2018","path":"/blog/2018/06/vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-for-the-week-of-june-1-2018/","author":[{"id":"5be72c28-6949-53f8-b212-3feb5a9983de","path":"gilzow","display_name":"Paul Gilzow","email":"gilzowp@missouri.edu","twitter":"gilzow","website":"http://missouri.edu/","company":"University of Missouri","company_position":"Programmer Analyst","bio":"Web application security and accessibility evangelist.

However, from what I understand, the core team will eventually enable this release for autoupdates, so if you are worried about it breaking your site, you&#8217;ll need to begin testing sooner rather than later.</p>\n<h2>Other Security News</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/05/service-leaked-locations-of-us-cell-phones-for-free-no-password-required/\">Website leaked real-time location of most US cell phones to almost anyone</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hardcoded-password-found-in-cisco-enterprise-software-again/\">Hardcoded Password Found in Cisco Enterprise Software, Again</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/@evstykas/remote-smart-car-hacking-with-just-a-phone-2fe7ca682162\">Remote smart car hacking with just a phone</a></li>\n</ul>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/plugins/"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/security/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"db3fa35c-bc99-5d8b-af49-aabf96913cbe","wordpress_id":24191,"slug":"vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-for-the-week-of-may-11-2018","path":"/blog/2018/05/vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-for-the-week-of-may-11-2018/","author":[{"id":"5be72c28-6949-53f8-b212-3feb5a9983de","path":"gilzow","display_name":"Paul Gilzow","email":"gilzowp@missouri.edu","twitter":"gilzow","website":"http://missouri.edu/","company":"University of Missouri","company_position":"Programmer Analyst","bio":"Web application security and accessibility evangelist.

While 4.9.5 will be a maintenance release, it will interestingly <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/try-out-gutenberg-call-out-will-be-in-4-9-5-release/\">include administrative dashboard call-outs</a> to try-out <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/\">Gutenberg</a> (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat_tip\">h/t</a> to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/briandeconinck?lang=en\">Brian DeConinck</a> for sharing the information).

Given that the security team rarely pre-announces security patches, and the highly critical rating, this patch will most likely be on-par with <a href=\"http://www.kalose.net/oss/drupal-7-drupalgeddon-exploit/\">Drualgeddon</a> in terms of severity.

If you have auto-updates enabled, you might have been surprised to see <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/02/wordpress-4-9-4-maintenance-release/\">another WordPress update (4.9.4)</a> come through Tuesday morning around 10am (CST). It seems there was a severe bug in 4.9.3 that caused the auto update feature to break in some sites and will require manual intervention to upgrade to 4.9.4. If you have auto-updates enabled and you did <em><strong>not</strong></em> see a notification of the update Tuesday morning, you will need to manually update to WordPress 4.9.4. Doing so will correct the issue and allow the auto-update feature to work for the next release.</p>\n<p>Separately, a denial-of-service vulnerability was <a href=\"https://baraktawily.blogspot.fr/2018/02/how-to-dos-29-of-world-wide-websites.html\">disclosed yesterday</a> that takes advantage of a default feature in WordPress to overwhelm the server targeting the load-scripts.php and load-styles.php files. Those two files will load up all requested scripts/styles and dynamically concatenate them into one file. The vulnerability comes into play when a request is given to them to load every possible script/style. There are 181 scripts included in core. Instructing the script to read and concatenate that many files into one file, for most hosts, will overwhelm the resources and cause the server to return 500 errors. According to the researcher, the WordPress security team didn’t consider it a core vulnerability and believe it should be handled at the server/host layer. The probability of someone legitimately enqueueing that many scripts/styles is probably fairly low, certainly lower than the probability of someone abusing this feature to cause issues. It should be entirely possible for core to limit the number of files being concatenated to X amount, with the ability to increase the number if problems are encountered.</p>\n<p>In response, the researcher has <a href=\"https://github.com/quitten/wordpress\">forked WordPress</a> with his fixes and has also provided a <a href=\"https://github.com/Quitten/WordPress/blob/master/wp-dos-patch.sh\">patch</a>, but I would <strong>not</strong> suggest using a forked version of WordPress. While the patch is straight-forward, it will require being reapplied after every update (so twice this week). Instead, I would suggest adding a couple of lines to your htaccess file to watch for requests to these file, and block them if the length of the load list is too long.</p>\n<pre>RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/wp-admin/load-(scripts|styles)\\.php$\r\nRewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} load(?:\\[\\])?=(.{256,})$\r\nRewriteRule ^(.*)$ - [F,L]\r\n</pre>\n<p>In the full list of scripts, there are 2650 characters. In the above htaccess example, I’ve set it so if there are more than 256 characters forbid the request. You may need to adjust that number upwards if you find your loaded scripts list is longer.</p>\n<p>If anyone is experienced in nginx conf files and can translate the above to nginx equivalent, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gilzow\">reach out to me</a>, and I&#8217;ll post it here.</p>\n<p>UPDATE: small update to the regex.

If you already use Burp for vulnerability scanning, then it&#8217;s nice to be able to include Burp WP to deep-dive into a WordPress site, without having to run WPScan separately.  I&#8217;ll be installing it on Monday to give it a test shortly after updating my sites to WordPress 4.9.3.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/plugins/"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/security/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"5f389430-5c17-5351-aa08-3c96fefc31c5","wordpress_id":17902,"slug":"vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-week-january-26-2018","path":"/blog/2018/01/vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-week-january-26-2018/","author":[{"id":"5be72c28-6949-53f8-b212-3feb5a9983de","path":"gilzow","display_name":"Paul Gilzow","email":"gilzowp@missouri.edu","twitter":"gilzow","website":"http://missouri.edu/","company":"University of Missouri","company_position":"Programmer Analyst","bio":"Web application security and accessibility evangelist.

It is a security and maintenance release and addresses a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability and 21 other bugs.  If you do not have auto-updates enabled, definitely get the update into your Change Management schedule as soon as possible.</p>\n<h2>Other Security News</h2>\n<p>Totally unrelated to higher education, but still concerning.  It was <a href=\"http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2018/Jan/63\">disclosed</a> earlier this week that there are multiple vulnerabilities in all ASUS brand routers: predictable session tokens, bypassing IP verification, passwords stored in plain text and logged-in information disclosure. While not necessarily popular as a commercial router, Asus routers are fairly popular among consumers.  Asus has released a firmware for several of the issues, with additional fixes coming in February.  If you own an ASUS router, have it check for a firmware update and then apply it as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>The other one I want to mention, given the use of <a href=\"https://shibboleth.net/\">Shibboleth</a> in Higher Ed, is the <a href=\"https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/en/advisories/rt-sa-2017-013/-truncation-of-saml-attributes-in-shibboleth-2\">disclosure</a> of a possible authorization bypass in Shibboleth last weekend by RedTeam Pentesting. This is connected to the Shibboleth <a href=\"https://shibboleth.net/community/advisories/secadv_20180112.txt\">security advisory</a> that went out on January 12.</p>\n<h2>WPCampus Online</h2>\n<p>Last, I want to make sure everyone is aware that <a href=\"https://online.dev5290.wpcampus.org/\">WPCampus Online</a> is in less than two weeks! We have a fantastic <a href=\"https://online.dev5290.wpcampus.org/schedule/\">schedule</a> lined up this year.

Unfortunately, vulnerabilities and disclosures did not rest. Two critical situations were disclosed during that time: an <a href=\"https://blog.nintechnet.com/arbitrary-file-upload-vulnerability-in-wordpress-learndash-lms-plugin/\">Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload</a> discovered in the <a href=\"https://www.learndash.com/\">LearnDash LMS</a> plugin by <a href=\"https://nintechnet.com/\">NinTechNet</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2017/12/plugin-backdoor-supply-chain/\">disclosure by WordFence</a> that three plugins (<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/duplicate-page-and-post/\">Duplicate Page and Post</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/nofollow-all-external-links/\">No Follow All External Links</a>, and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-noexternallinks/\">WP No External Links</a>) contained backdoor code in current versions in the WordPress plugin repository, and appear to be aimed at injecting SEO spam into sites&#8217; output.  The WordPress plugin team have closed all three to new installs from the repository, and released a cleaned version of WP No External Links.  If you are using any of these plugins, you should remove them immediately, and begin looking for a replacement.</p>\n<p>As I <a href=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/2017/12/vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-week-december-22-2017/\">mentioned in my last post</a>, I firmly believe this situation will become ever more prevalent. As a site owner, once you have vetted a plugin and installed it on your site, you trust that future updates will also be safe. It is unfeasible to believe that the majority of site owners will re-evaluate a plugin&#8217;s code after every update.  I know at the University of Missouri, we struggle to get apps re-evaluated every 6 months, let alone every time there&#8217;s a new update to a dependency (plugin) in a site.  While I know that the openness of the WordPress plugin/theme repository has definitely assisted in propelling WordPress to its current market share, with that power, comes responsibility.  As a community, we need to begin to balance the openness of the repository with the responsibility of protecting its users.</p>\n<h2>Other Security News</h2>\n<p>The GIGANTIC news this week was the <a href=\"https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.co.za/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html\">disclosure</a> on January 3rd by the Project Zero team at Google of vulnerabilities in processors (<a href=\"https://spectreattack.com/\">dubbed <em>Meltdown</em> and <em>Spectre</em></a>) from Intel, AMD, and ARM dating all the way back to 1995. Essentially, every device that contains a CPU from the last two decades is susceptible. In addition, it is theoretically possible for these attacks to occur through a website. Operating Systems can, and will be introducing patches over the coming days to mitigate the risk. As you are notified of these patches, please update immediately.  <a href=\"https://www.theregister.co.uk\">The Register</a> was the first news outlet to break the story and has an excellent <a href=\"https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/01/02/intel_cpu_design_flaw/\">write-up</a> covering these vulnerabilities in more detail.</p>\n<p>As site owners, we need to make sure that our hosting partners have updated the underlying operating systems our sites run on.  Many of the major hosting providers have already patched, or announced upcoming patches to protect against these vulnerabilities. If you have not heard from your hosting provider, you should definitely contact them and ask when they plan to apply updates.</p>\n<p>Since it is possible for these attacks to occur online, what can you do to protect yourself until your OS is patched?  Both Google Chrome and <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2018/01/03/mitigations-landing-new-class-timing-attack/\">Firefox</a> are vulnerable currently, with <a href=\"https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/7622138\">Google planning to release a fix in version 64 of Chrome, due out January 23rd</a>. In the meantime, you can enable Site Isolation in Chrome by navigating to</p>\n<blockquote><p>chrome://flags/#enable-site-per-process</p></blockquote>\n<p>in the address bar of Chrome and clicking <strong>Enable</strong>. You will then need to relaunch Chrome. For FireFox, they have released <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2018-01/\">partial fixes in version 57.0.4</a> with additional fixes to be released on January 23rd. Beyond that, the normal precautions should be taken: only install apps (including those on your phones/tablets) from known, safe sources; don&#8217;t click on links in emails, sms text messages, online message boards, etc. that are from people you don&#8217;t know, or in situations where you weren&#8217;t expecting them; and apply updates for all of your devices as soon as they are available.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/plugins/"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/security/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"c1469af9-6114-57aa-b738-f6f9a76690ae","wordpress_id":17458,"slug":"vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-week-december-22-2017","path":"/blog/2017/12/vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-week-december-22-2017/","author":[{"id":"5be72c28-6949-53f8-b212-3feb5a9983de","path":"gilzow","display_name":"Paul Gilzow","email":"gilzowp@missouri.edu","twitter":"gilzow","website":"http://missouri.edu/","company":"University of Missouri","company_position":"Programmer Analyst","bio":"Web application security and accessibility evangelist.

The committer was <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/otto42\"><span class=\"s2\">Otto</span></a> so I’ll assume the WordPress plugin team removed the offending code and pushed the update.  Please make sure you have updated to 4.4.5 of the plugin and change the password on your admin accounts.  Also check for any additional user accounts that you do not recognize.  </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">This disclosure highlights (yet again), that the WordPress community really needs to think about the current state of how plugins are handled, and how we&#8217;re going to address plugin security as we head into 2018. There are over 50,000 plugins in the WordPress repository and only a handful of people on the plugin review team.  Even if they had 100 people on the review team, there&#8217;s no way they could feasibly review all code submissions in a timely manner.  I know many in the community would be unhappy adopting a Drupal-style review process, as that process takes much, much longer than what WordPress developers are used to.  However, this is the third (maybe fourth?) time this year we&#8217;ve seen a popular plugin shift to a new developer who introduces code for malicious intent. I&#8217;m hoping that the upcoming <a href=\"https://xwp.co/tide-a-path-to-better-code-across-the-wordpress-ecosystem/\">Tide project</a> will help in some way, but automated scans rarely are able to uncover all issues.   As a community, we need to drastically change the way we look at, and handle plugins.  When a third of the entire web relies on you, a nonchalant attitude toward security is no longer acceptable.</span></p>\n<h2>Other News</h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ll be out next week for the holiday break, so there will be no report next Friday.  I&#8217;ll release a two week report on January 5, 2018. I hope everyone has a <strong>fantastic</strong> holiday season.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/plugins/"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/security/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"aff7a298-3284-5cc7-8cd0-21353b108729","wordpress_id":17130,"slug":"vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-week-december-15-2017","path":"/blog/2017/12/vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-week-december-15-2017/","author":[{"id":"5be72c28-6949-53f8-b212-3feb5a9983de","path":"gilzow","display_name":"Paul Gilzow","email":"gilzowp@missouri.edu","twitter":"gilzow","website":"http://missouri.edu/","company":"University of Missouri","company_position":"Programmer Analyst","bio":"Web application security and accessibility evangelist.

I recently had the pleasure to chat with Andrew Scheifele (who had a hand in the DorkBot project) about how the service has worked for us and where the service is headed.  This past summer, Dorkbot (along with <a href=\"https://security.utexas.edu/apps-services\">several other technologies</a>) was <a href=\"https://www.saltycloud.com/2017/06/23/saltycloud-in-licences-cybersecurity-ip-from-ut-austin/\">licensed</a> to <a href=\"https://www.saltycloud.com/\">SaltyCloud,</a> a SaaS InfoSec company, and as of late this fall now serves over 300 campuses across the planet.  Andrew reassured me that SaltyCloud is committed to continuing to providing the DorkBot service to higher education institutions for no charge, though they may begin to offer value-added services on top of the DorkBot service.  They&#8217;re also looking to expand the current DorkBot offering to include (possibly) a dashboard to manage discovered vulnerabilities in your network.</p>\n<p>As I&#8217;ve mentioned before, we have been very pleased with the DorkBot service. We are a completely decentralized campus in terms of the web, and DorkBot has helped us to identify vulnerabilities in sites we didn&#8217;t even know existed.   For those of you in higher ed, I would encourage you to contact SaltyCloud (either through the <a href=\"https://www.saltycloud.com/dorkbot/\">company itself,</a> or through <a href=\"https://security.utexas.edu/dorkbot\">UT Austin</a>) and give the service a try.  If you do, I would <strong>love</strong> to hear from you about your experience.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/plugins/"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/security/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"8bbff3c2-cdaa-562d-99d8-6eda916fa827","wordpress_id":17055,"slug":"vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-week-december-8-2017","path":"/blog/2017/12/vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-week-december-8-2017/","author":[{"id":"5be72c28-6949-53f8-b212-3feb5a9983de","path":"gilzow","display_name":"Paul Gilzow","email":"gilzowp@missouri.edu","twitter":"gilzow","website":"http://missouri.edu/","company":"University of Missouri","company_position":"Programmer Analyst","bio":"Web application security and accessibility evangelist.

Many of you this week, hopefully, are attending <a href=\"https://2017.us.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp US </a> in beautiful Nashville. If you are, please be sure to say &#8220;hello&#8221; to our colleagues from <a href=\"https://www.vanderbilt.edu/\">Vanderbilt</a> who run a massive, and quite impressive, WordPress instance.</p>\n<h2>WordPress Security News</h2>\n<p>Earlier this week, WordPress version <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/11/wordpress-4-9-1-security-and-maintenance-release/\">4.9.1</a> was released.  In addition to being a maintenance release correcting eleven bugs, 4.9.1 addresses four security issues, so you are strongly encouraged to get the updates scheduled into your Change Management cycle as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>In other WordPress news, <a href=\"https://xwp.co/\">XWP</a> <a href=\"https://xwp.co/tide-a-path-to-better-code-across-the-wordpress-ecosystem/\">announced</a> a new project, <a href=\"https://wptide.org/\">Tide</a>, with an aim to provide automated testing for plugins and themes to assist developers in writing better code.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Tide, a project started here at XWP and supported by Google, Automattic, and WP Engine, aims to equip WordPress users and developers to make better decisions about the plugins and themes they install and build.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/tide-project-aims-to-audit-and-score-wordpress-themes-and-plugins-based-on-code-quality#comment-241498\">Comments</a> from some of the XWP employees in the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/tide-project-aims-to-audit-and-score-wordpress-themes-and-plugins-based-on-code-quality\">WPTavern story</a> indicated they will be using the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress-Coding-Standards/WordPress-Coding-Standards\">WordPress Coding Standards rules</a> for <a href=\"https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer\">PHP_CodeSniffer</a> to facilitate some of the testing.  While I&#8217;m not 100% convinced of assigning a grade or star rating to the test results, I applaud any effort to add testing of submitted code to the repository. XWP plans to demonstrate Tide at WCUS this weekend and I look forward to hearing impressions from people who are able to demo it. I hope XWP is able to open up the service shortly so the community can work toward improving the code quality of submitted code.</p>\n<h2>Other Security News</h2>\n<p>Right before Thanksgiving, the <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/\">OWASP foundation</a> <a href=\"https://owasp.blogspot.com/2017/11/owasp-is-pleased-to-announce-release-of.html\">announced</a> the release of the <a href=\"https://github.com/OWASP/Top10/tree/master/2017\">OWASP Top 10 2017 edition</a>.  Three new entries were added in this edition: <a href=\"https://github.com/OWASP/Top10/blob/master/2017/en/0xa8-insecure-deserialization.md\">A8-2017 Insecure Deserialization</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/OWASP/Top10/blob/master/2017/en/0xaa-logging-detection-response.md\">A10-2017 Insufficient Logging and Monitoring</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/OWASP/Top10/blob/master/2017/en/0xa4-xxe.md\">A4-2017 XML External Entities (XXE)</a>.

If your institution is like mine, they only patch servers once a month.  In this case, the patch was released after the patch window for October, and well before the window for November. I would encourage you to check your institution&#8217;s version to see what version you have installed and work with your system administrator(s) to do an emergency patch if you are running a vulnerable version.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/plugins/"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/security/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"3fd0f4fe-5ea3-5c15-a00a-b0e577f73452","wordpress_id":16688,"slug":"vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-week-november-3-2017","path":"/blog/2017/11/vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-week-november-3-2017/","author":[{"id":"5be72c28-6949-53f8-b212-3feb5a9983de","path":"gilzow","display_name":"Paul Gilzow","email":"gilzowp@missouri.edu","twitter":"gilzow","website":"http://missouri.edu/","company":"University of Missouri","company_position":"Programmer Analyst","bio":"Web application security and accessibility evangelist.

I&#8217;ve compiled all of last week&#8217;s disclosures into the list for this week&#8217;s.</p>\n<h2>Other Security News</h2>\n<p>The big news, in my opinion, late last week was the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vanderaj/status/918983325770858496\">announcement</a> of the <a href=\"https://github.com/OWASP/Top10/blob/master/2017/OWASP-Top-10-2017-en.pdf\">second release candidate for the OWASP Top Ten 2017</a>.  As with the first release candidate, A4-2013 Insecure Direct Object References and A7-2013 Missing Function Level Access Controls were merged into the new A6-2017 Access Control.  Removed from the 2013 list are A8-2013 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and A10-2013 Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards. When <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vanderaj/status/919286279585480705\">I asked</a> about A8&#8217;s removal, the current project lead replied that it was number thirteen in their data set, and exploitable in 4% of pen test results.  In our internal audits of systems on campus, CSRF is a consistent, exploitable issue.  But then, higher education almost always lags behind the rest of the industry.  A3-2013 Cross-Site Scripting has been moved to position seven (A7-2017), and two new entries have been added: A4-2017 XML External Entity (XXE) and A10-2017 Insufficient Logging and Monitoring.  I won&#8217;t try to explain XXE as <a href=\"https://sensepost.com/blog/2014/revisting-xxe-and-abusing-protocols/\">this sensepost blog post</a> does a much better job than I could, but I am surprised this issue rose to the level of making it into the top 10.  I haven&#8217;t seen any XXE issues in our internal scans for some time.  A10-2017 Insufficient Logging and Monitoring was named A7-2017 Insufficient Attack Protection in the first Release Candidate and caused <a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/3192505/security/contrast-security-responds-to-owasp-top-10-controversy.html\">quite</a> <a href=\"http://www.skeletonscribe.net/2017/04/abusing-owasp.html\">a bit</a> of <a href=\"https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/2017-owasp-top-10-a7/\">drama</a> in the security community, despite Dave Wichers&#8217; excellent job of <a href=\"http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-topten/2017-April/001410.html\">explaining the intent </a>behind its entry. I&#8217;m glad they&#8217;ve renamed it to describe the issue more accurately, but it will be interesting to see if it is accepted by the security community.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/plugins/"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/security/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"59d8573a-8d75-5be9-aa18-a8cdd9ab8d2d","wordpress_id":16132,"slug":"vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-week-october-6-2017","path":"/blog/2017/10/vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-week-october-6-2017/","author":[{"id":"5be72c28-6949-53f8-b212-3feb5a9983de","path":"gilzow","display_name":"Paul Gilzow","email":"gilzowp@missouri.edu","twitter":"gilzow","website":"http://missouri.edu/","company":"University of Missouri","company_position":"Programmer Analyst","bio":"Web application security and accessibility evangelist.

The first is an authenticated arbitrary file upload vulnerability in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpbooklist/\">WordPress Book List </a>plugin, <a href=\"https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2017/10/02/authenticated-arbitrary-file-upload-vulnerability-in-wordpress-book-list/\">disclosed by pluginvulnerabilities.com.</a>  As for versions affected, they don&#8217;t list how far back the vulnerability goes. In looking back through the versions, it goes back to at least v5.0. There was a major code restructuring between 4.4 and 5.0, and it <em>appears</em> that the vulnerability was introduced at that point.</p>\n<p>Next are authenticated Object Injection and <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF)\">Cross-Site Request Forgery</a> vulnerabilities in the plugin Event List (which has been removed from the public plugin repository, also <a href=\"https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2017/10/06/authenticated-php-object-injection-vulnerability-in-event-list/\">disclosed by pluginvulnerabilities.com</a>.  In looking through the code, it appears the vulnerability was <a href=\"https://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/event-list/tags/0.7.3/admin/includes/admin-import.php\">introduced at version 0.7.3</a>. You are encouraged to remove the plugin.</p>\n<p>Last is both authenticated and unauthenticated <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Blind_SQL_Injection\">Blind SQL Injection</a> vulnerabilities in the plugin <a href=\"https://codecanyon.net/item/content-timeline-responsive-wordpress-plugin-for-displaying-postscategories-in-a-sliding-timeline/3027163\">Content Timeline</a>. According to the disclosure, the author of the plugin never responded. In looking at the <a href=\"http://www.shindiristudio.com/timelinewp/demo/wp-content/plugins/content_timeline/README.md\">readme file from the demo site,</a>  the last update was sometime in 2017, but doesn&#8217;t mention any changes related to SQL Injection. Therefore, the assumption is that the current version is still vulnerable. As this is a paid plugin, I would recommend contacting the vendor directly and ask if the vulnerabilities have been addressed.  If you do not receive a quick response, then I would recommend removing the plugin and finding an alternative solution.</p>\n<h2>Other Security News</h2>\n<p>Earlier this week, Curl, the popular command line tool for transfer data to or from a server, <a href=\"https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20171004.html\">released an update</a> to address a vulnerability where a malicious server could send a malformed response to a PWD command, causing curl to crash.  Affected versions are 7.7 up to and including 7.55.1. There are no known exploits targeting this vulnerability.</p>\n<p>Also revealed earlier this week, <a href=\"https://securitynews.io/2017/10/2013-yahoo-breach-3-billion/\">Yahoo now believes</a> that <strong>all</strong> accounts were affected in the <a href=\"https://threatpost.com/yahoo-discloses-data-from-1-billion-accounts-stolen-in-2013/122520/\">2013 breach</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Subsequent to Yahoo’s acquisition by Verizon, and during integration, the company recently obtained new intelligence and now believes, following an investigation with the assistance of outside forensic experts, that all Yahoo user accounts were affected by the August 2013 theft.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Essentially, if you had a Yahoo account prior to August 2013, your account was affected by the breach.  If you haven&#8217;t already done so, you really need to go <a href=\"https://login.yahoo.com/account/security?.lang=en-US&amp;.intl=us&amp;.src=yhelp\">change your password</a>.</p>\n<h2>HighEdWeb</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.highedweb.org/\">HighEdWeb</a>, <strong>the</strong> best conference for those of who work on the web and in higher education starts on Sunday! WPCampus will be there, as will many of our WPCampus community members (myself included).  I&#8217;ll be <a href=\"https://2017.highedweb.org/schedule/#WRK2\">teaching a hands-on workshop</a> on Sunday covering the <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project\">OWASP Top 10</a> and how to mitigate your risks. Last I checked there are still some seats available, so if you aren&#8217;t already committed on Sunday afternoon come join me.  Also, our very own <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bamadesigner\">Rachel Cherry</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cgrymala\">Curtiss Grymala</a> will be <a href=\"https://2017.highedweb.org/schedule/#WRK4\">teaching a workshop on WordPress in Higher Ed</a>. If you don&#8217;t come to my workshop, then I&#8217;d highly suggest attending theirs.  Either way, if you&#8217;ll be attending, definitely stop in the DPA (aka tech) track and say hello. I&#8217;d love to chat about security or WordPress!</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/plugins/"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/security/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"24b71c8c-7e83-563b-b4b9-4b4760844d25","wordpress_id":15940,"slug":"vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-week-september-29-2017","path":"/blog/2017/09/vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-week-september-29-2017/","author":[{"id":"5be72c28-6949-53f8-b212-3feb5a9983de","path":"gilzow","display_name":"Paul Gilzow","email":"gilzowp@missouri.edu","twitter":"gilzow","website":"http://missouri.edu/","company":"University of Missouri","company_position":"Programmer Analyst","bio":"Web application security and accessibility evangelist.

This means an attacker could upload a backdoor script to your site and then access it in your site&#8217;s /wp-content/uploads/ directory.  If you remember back to my <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/gilzow/access-denied-75716045\"><em>Access Denied</em> presentation</a>, this scenario is precisely why I suggest denying access to all file types in the uploads directory except for those you specifically want the public to have access to.  It is highly recommended that you remove this plugin immediately.</p>\n<p>While not in the report this week, I came across a <a href=\"http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/Google-dork-query\">google dork</a> <a href=\"https://www.exploit-db.com/ghdb/4544/\">entry</a> in exploit-db.com that targets the .user.ini file generated by  the WordFence plugin.  The .user.ini file contains a full path listing to the wordfence-waf.php file.  By default, the plugin should include an entry in the site&#8217;s .htaccess file to deny access to this file.  In addition, it should warn nginx user&#8217;s to include an entry in their configuration file.  However, it doesn&#8217;t appear that the plugin verifies an .htaccess file is actually in use, or that the nginx configuration has been made.  IIS users are simply out-of-luck with no warning or instructions on how to deny access to the file.  A quick <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=filetype%3Aini+%22wordfence%22&amp;oq=filetype%3Aini+%22wordfence%22&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i58j69i61&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">search</a> shows that there are quite a few sites out there using Wordfence with no protection against disclosing this information.   Now, the disclosure of the full path <em>by itself</em> won&#8217;t compromise your site. However, this information can be used in combination with other attacks that require knowing the server path.  Regardless, if you use Wordfence, I would suggest checking your site to see if you can access the .user.ini file.  If so, make sure to add the configuration changes needed in order to block it from public access. If you run into issues figuring out how to do so, reach out to me and I&#8217;ll assist.</p>\n<h2>WordPress Security News</h2>\n<p>In other WordPress security news, version 4.8.2 was <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/09/wordpress-4-8-2-security-and-maintenance-release/\">released</a> earlier this week.  4.8.2 <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.8.2\">addresses</a> nine security issues, and six maintenance issues.  Hopefully you have auto-updates enabled and have already received the update, but if not, you should update as soon as feasibly possible.</p>\n<h2>Other Security New</h2>\n<p>In other security news that might affect you, a new Apache vulnerability dubbed OptionsBleed was <a href=\"https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/60-Optionsbleed-HTTP-OPTIONS-method-can-leak-Apaches-server-memory.html\">disclosed</a> this week that affects versions of Apache 2.2.34 and earlier, and version 2.4.27 and earlier. Apache has <a href=\"https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/httpd/httpd/branches/2.4.x/server/core.c?r1=1805223&amp;r2=1807754&amp;pathrev=1807754&amp;view=patch\">released a patch</a> to fix the issue.  Without getting too technical, if a misconfiguration has occurred in a user&#8217;s web account, a malicious actor can send a request to the server, and due to the misconfiguration, Apache will leak contents from memory.  Since the misconfiguration can occur in the user&#8217;s account, a malicious actor could intentionally cause the misconfiguration in a shared hosting environment.  NakedSecurity has a <a href=\"https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2017/09/19/apache-optionsbleed-vulnerability-what-you-need-to-know/\">great write-up</a> if you&#8217;re interested in the technical specifics.  If you are on shared hosting, I would suggest talking to your host and make sure they have patched their systems.</p>\n<p>Next up, many of us use slack as a way to collaborate among workers, friends and community members.  Most often, those slack teams are meant only for people who should have access.  Researcher Inti De Ceukelaire recently <a href=\"https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-i-hacked-hundreds-of-companies-through-their-helpdesk-b7680ddc2d4c\">discovered</a> a way to bypass that gateway and gain access to many companies&#8217; internal communications by using their online ticket systems, or online help desk systems.  By using a company&#8217;s support email (e.g. support@company.com), he was then able to sign into a company&#8217;s slack channel.  He&#8217;s dubbed the bypass TicketTrick and unfortunately, the same issue affects Yammer and Facebook Workplace. As for remediation, one option is to make your team invite-only instead of basing it on company email. The other is to consider using different domain names for their email issue trackers and support help desks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/plugins/"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/security/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"5725b910-6d1b-57d9-890e-1984b5d34433","wordpress_id":15740,"slug":"vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-week-september-15-2017","path":"/blog/2017/09/vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-week-september-15-2017/","author":[{"id":"5be72c28-6949-53f8-b212-3feb5a9983de","path":"gilzow","display_name":"Paul Gilzow","email":"gilzowp@missouri.edu","twitter":"gilzow","website":"http://missouri.edu/","company":"University of Missouri","company_position":"Programmer Analyst","bio":"Web application security and accessibility evangelist.

I&#8217;ve also reached out to contacts at iThemes to make sure they know about the issue and see if they have addressed it. It&#8217;s also important to note that the vulnerabilities are only present in multisite, when the multisite support for Backupbuddy has been enabled.</p>\n<p>The other big disclosure occurred late Friday of last week concerning the <a href=\"http://strategy11.com/display-widgets/\">Display Widgets plugin</a>.  The original developer <a href=\"http://wpdevs.co.uk/sell-your-plugin/\"><strong>sold</strong> the plugin</a> to a new developer this summer. Shortly thereafter, code was included in the plugin that allowed the new developer to insert content into any site using the plugin (which had about 200K installs).   The plugin then went through several rounds of being removed from the repository, developer submitting a new version (with the malicious code still present) and the plugin being reinstated in the repository.  Finally, the plugin was removed for a fourth and final time late last Friday.  If you are using the Display Widgets you need to either <strong>remove it immediately</strong>, or downgrade to version 2.05 which was the last version before the plugin was taken over by the new developer.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this highlights one of the major issues with the current plugin repository: no security oversight in plugins that are submitted.  And as WordPress&#8217; market share continues to grow, the plugin repository will continue to be an attractive target for attackers, or in the case of this plugin, someone looking to use it for <a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2017/09/man-behind-plugin-spam-mason-soiza/\">blackhat SEO</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/plugins/"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/security/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"11bdc14d-5f4f-5743-87a8-f55bb4efa51d","wordpress_id":15491,"slug":"vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-september-8-2017","path":"/blog/2017/09/vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-september-8-2017/","author":[{"id":"5be72c28-6949-53f8-b212-3feb5a9983de","path":"gilzow","display_name":"Paul Gilzow","email":"gilzowp@missouri.edu","twitter":"gilzow","website":"http://missouri.edu/","company":"University of Missouri","company_position":"Programmer Analyst","bio":"Web application security and accessibility evangelist.

If you haven&#8217;t head about it yet, I strongly recommend you read the <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/09/breach-at-equifax-may-impact-143m-americans/\">write up</a> by Brian Krebs over at <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/\">krebsonsecurity.com</a>. The TL;DR is</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Equifax</strong>, one of the “big-three” U.S. credit bureaus, said today a data breach at the company may have affected 143 million Americans, jeopardizing consumer Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses and some driver’s license numbers.</p></blockquote>\n<p>To put that in perspective, the U.S. population is just shy of <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/popclock/\">325 million</a>; this means 45% of the <strong>entire</strong> United States population is affected by this breach.  Given the numbers, there&#8217;s a very good chance you were involved in the leak.  Equifax has a <a href=\"https://trustedidpremier.com/eligibility/eligibility.html\">site set up</a> where you can <a href=\"https://trustedidpremier.com/eligibility/eligibility.html\">check to see</a> if your information was included in the leak. They are offering twelve months of credit monitoring service through TrustedID Premiere (interestingly, TrustedID is a wholly owned subsidary of Equifax).  However, before you enroll, be sure to read the <a href=\"https://trustedidpremier.com/static/terms\">terms of service</a> as enrolling waives your rights to sue, or be a member of a class-action suit against Equifax in the future. If you&#8217;re worried about not having the monitoring in place, read Krebs&#8217; article on <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/11/report-everyone-should-get-a-security-freeze/\">credit file freezes</a>.</p>\n<p>So far Equifax has not disclosed how the breach occurred, only that they discovered &#8220;unauthorized access&#8221; by &#8220;exploiting an application vulnerability.&#8221; While we do not know yet if WordPress was involved in the breach, it is interesting that the www.equifaxsecurity2017.com site is <a href=\"https://www.equifaxsecurity2017.com/wp-content/themes/sierra_2017/style.css\">running WordPress</a>, and up until a few hours ago, was still leaking user names via the user REST API endpoint.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-15641 aligncenter\" src=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/wp-content/uploads/equifax-users-800x167.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"167\" srcset=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/wp-content/uploads/equifax-users-800x167.jpg 800w, https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/wp-content/uploads/equifax-users-768x160.jpg 768w, https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/wp-content/uploads/equifax-users.jpg 908w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>Another <a href=\"https://lgtm.com/blog/apache_struts_CVE-2017-9805_announcement\">large disclosure</a> this week was with the <a href=\"https://struts.apache.org/\">Apache Struts framework</a> which involved an issue with the framework&#8217;s REST plugin, whereby arbitrary code execution could occur via unsafe deserialization. This is a critical vulnerability and you are encouraged to <a href=\"https://struts.apache.org/announce.html\">update</a> immediately if you are using Struts.  Deserialization is complicated to protect against, and is coming becoming a big enough issue that it <a href=\"https://github.com/OWASP/Top10/issues/92\">might be included</a> in the OWASP Top 10 for 2017.</p>\n<p>Speaking of the OWASP Top 10, yet another <a href=\"https://www.upguard.com/breaches/cloud-leak-tigerswan\">disclosure this week</a> highlighted why knowing how and where your sensitive data is being stored is so critical (<a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A6-Sensitive_Data_Exposure\">A6: Sensitive Data Exposure</a>).  A Researcher from Upguard discovered a publicly accessible AWS storage bucket containing 9,400 resumes from people who had applied for a job at TigerSwan, an international security company. However, the information wasn&#8217;t left in the storage bucket by TigerSwan, but by a recruiting vendor TigerSwan had previously hired.  Even if TigerSwan followed all best practices for securing data, sharing that data with a vendor who failed to do so has damaged their reputation, and more importantly, left the individuals who trusted them with their data vulnerable to identity theft.</p>\n<h2>Opportunities</h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in Application Security, tradepub.com is offering a couple of good security-related eBooks for free right now: <em><a href=\"http://webcodegeeks.tradepub.com/free/w_pacb47/\">Penetration Testing &#8211; A Survival Guide</a></em> and <em><a href=\"http://webcodegeeks.tradepub.com/free/w_aaaa5051/\">Web Application Security for Dummies</a></em>.

Also disclosed this week were <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/PHP_Object_Injection\">PHP Object Injection</a> vulnerabilities in the plugins <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/jayj-quicktag/\">JayJ Quicktag,</a> <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/videowhisper-live-streaming-integration/\">VideoWhisper Live Streaming</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-smart-security/\">WP Smart Security</a> (currently unfixed).  All three were discovered by researchers at <a href=\"https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/\">pluginvulnerabilities.com</a>. For the WP Smart Security vulnerability, they utilized the <a href=\"http://php-grinder.com/\">php-grinder.com</a> service. PHP-Grinder is a <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Static_Code_Analysis#Description\">static analysis</a> tool designed specially to scan WordPress plugins and PHP-based GitHub projects for potential security vulnerabilities.   If you&#8217;re new to static analysis, this is a great introduction to see how static analysis works.  In looking at the <a href=\"http://php-grinder.com/project/view/21868\">report</a> for WP Smart Security, we can see it <a href=\"http://php-grinder.com/vulns/view/3903988\">identified</a> a potentially insecure use of <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/function.unserialize.php\">unserialize</a> on line 20 of secure.php.  Looking at the source we find unserialize is being called on the contents of $HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA after being base64 decoded, which is definitely of concern.</p>\n<p>I was fortunate to use the initial 0.1 beta of php-grinder.com and have been extremely happy with the 0.2 version.  I would encourage you to test out your own plugins/projects for issues. If you decide to test any plugins that you use, and you do find a vulnerability, please be sure to communicate <em>immediately</em> with the author.

The fix is easy enough: at the beginning of the process, ensure the user is authorized.  Luckily, WordPress makes this easy for us through the function <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/current_user_can\">current_user_can()</a> which you can use to check to make sure the user has the needed capabilities (permissions) necessary to perform an action or access a resource.</p>\n<p><code><br />\nfunction my_awesome_function()<br />\n{<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if(current_user_can('edit_others_posts'){<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//do stuff<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br />\n}<br />\n</code></p>\n<p>Like many things in secure coding, the fix isn&#8217;t insurmountable, you just have to know what to do and remember to do it!</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/plugins/"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/security/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"2a4faac6-dae8-5830-ad44-5dbbc695d803","wordpress_id":15244,"slug":"vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-themes-report-august-18-2017","path":"/blog/2017/08/vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-themes-report-august-18-2017/","author":[{"id":"5be72c28-6949-53f8-b212-3feb5a9983de","path":"gilzow","display_name":"Paul Gilzow","email":"gilzowp@missouri.edu","twitter":"gilzow","website":"http://missouri.edu/","company":"University of Missouri","company_position":"Programmer Analyst","bio":"Web application security and accessibility evangelist.

As before, in most situations this will be someone with an administrator account who, if were a bad actor, could cause more damage in other ways.  But it once again highlights that we need to make sure people are given the minimum amount of privileges to perform their jobs, and as developers, ensure that we are parameterizing/binding <strong>all</strong> queries.</p>\n<p>The second one I want to highlight was discovered by researcher <a href=\"https://twitter.com/padannewitz\">Paul Dannewitz</a>, who discovered a SQL Injection vulnerability in the plugin <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/i-recommend-this/\">I Recommend This</a>. I Recommend This has over 40K active installs, and only requires a user to have a subscriber-level role. What&#8217;s particularly interesting about this exploit is that vulnerability is in the handling of data passed in via a shortcode.

During an 18 month period, they tracked over 2 million security incidents, from 3800 customers.  While ransomware has certainly been making the headlines, it was web application attacks that made up almost 75% of those tracked incidents with SQL Injection attacks making up just over half, leading Alert Logic to state:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Web applications are the soft underbelly of your organization – the number-one means by which attackers breach data.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Many of the web applications attacks targeted third-party components (i.e. plugins and themes) which, as developers, is on us.  If you are creating custom plugins or themes, <strong>please</strong> set aside some time to go through some secure coding tutorials.  If you&#8217;ll be attending <a href=\"https://2017.highedweb.org\">HighEdWeb</a> this year (and I highly recommend it) come take my security-focused <a href=\"https://2017.highedweb.org/schedule/\">pre-conference workshop</a>.  Check out the <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Secure_Coding_Practices_-_Quick_Reference_Guide\">OWASP Secure Coding Practices quick reference guide</a>, or look into some tutorials over at <a href=\"https://www.lynda.com/Programming-Foundations-tutorials/Introduction-secure-coding/418266/450307-4.html\">lynda.com</a>. It&#8217;s up to us to step up our game and help secure the web.</p>\n<p>Speaking of ransomware, <a href=\"https://wordfence.com/\">Wordfence</a> put out <a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2017/08/ransomware-wordpress/\">an interesting post</a> about a new ransomeware that&#8217;s targeting WordPress specifically.  From reading the article, it appears that after compromising the site (WordFence fails to say how the sites are initially compromised), the site is then encrypted and held ransom until the owner pays the ransom.  The best way to protect yourself is the same as always: keep WordPress core, your plugins and your themes up-to-date, be skeptical of any third-party code you add to your site, and lock as many things down as possible.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://sucuri.net/\">Sucuri</a> did a f<a href=\"https://blog.sucuri.net/2017/08/how-to-restore-website-backups-from-the-command-line.html\">ollow-up post</a> to their post last week on backing up your site using command-line tools: <em><a href=\"https://blog.sucuri.net/2017/08/how-to-restore-website-backups-from-the-command-line.html\">How to Restore Website Backups from the Command Line</a></em>.

One of the interesting items was the increased attacks on <a href=\"https://wp-rocket.me/\">wp-rocket</a> which had a Local File Inclusion vulnerability disclosed at the end of July (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zTfpdEKzquGdk6y7lztnt0E18yZLe_8hH5V1AFN4474/edit?usp=sharing\">see the July 28th Vulnerable Plugins Report</a>). This highlights how critical it is to keep your plugins up-to-date as attackers are most definitely targeting these vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>Next, <a href=\"https://sucuri.net/\">Sucuri</a> did a great <a href=\"https://blog.sucuri.net/2017/08/website-backups-using-command-line-tools.html\">post</a> earlier this week on creating website backups with no plugins, just ssh + command line tools. Having a good, clean back up of your files and database is a <em>critical</em>, yet often over-looked component of a solid security strategy.  If you already have a plugin that creates scheduled backups and stores them offsite (please don&#8217;t store your backups on the same server as your website), then you are one step ahead of most. However, if you&#8217;ve ever been in the situation where a plugin won&#8217;t work, or you can&#8217;t find one that supports storing to a particular storage service, you don&#8217;t necessarily <strong>need</strong> a plugin.  By using ssh and some <a href=\"https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Bash_Shell_Scripting\">bash scripting</a> you can back up your site(s) and store them to any service needed.  Definitely check out their post and don&#8217;t be afraid to get your hands dirty in the terminal!</p>\n<h2>Other Security News</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/\">PostgreSQL</a> released <a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/1772/\">critical updates</a> yesterday for all of their supported versions (9.6.X, 9.5.X, 9.4.X, 9.3.X, and 9.2.X).  The update addresses three vulnerabilities: e<a href=\"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-7546\">mpty passwords accepted as valid in certain authentication methods</a>, <a href=\"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-7547\">information disclosure</a>, and <a href=\"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-7548\">privilege escalation.</a>  If you administer a system that runs PostgreSQL, you are encouraged to update as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://apache.org/\">Apache Software Foundation</a> also released critical updates yesterday for the <a href=\"https://subversion.apache.org/\">Subversion client.</a>  The updates address two vulnerabilities: <a href=\"https://subversion.apache.org/security/CVE-2016-8734-advisory.txt\">denial of service attack</a>, and <a href=\"https://subversion.apache.org/security/CVE-2017-9800-advisory.txt\">arbitrary code execution</a>. These vulnerabilities are particularly interesting because the attacks target subversion <em>clients</em> not necessarily the subversion server, with the code execution being especially concerning:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;A maliciously constructed svn+ssh:// URL would cause Subversion clients to run an arbitrary shell command. Such a URL could be generated by a malicious server, by a malicious user committing to a[sic] honest server (to attack another user of that server&#8217;s repositories), or by a proxy server.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>You&#8217;ll need to update your subversion client, which could prove interesting if your subversion client is embedded in your IDE, or the package you use sits on top of subversion&#8217;s client.  You&#8217;ll need to check with your vendor for an update.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/plugins/"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/security/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"b9569a9b-7832-578c-95c2-4fa41c1693ae","wordpress_id":15000,"slug":"vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-august-4-2017","path":"/blog/2017/08/vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-august-4-2017/","author":[{"id":"5be72c28-6949-53f8-b212-3feb5a9983de","path":"gilzow","display_name":"Paul Gilzow","email":"gilzowp@missouri.edu","twitter":"gilzow","website":"http://missouri.edu/","company":"University of Missouri","company_position":"Programmer Analyst","bio":"Web application security and accessibility evangelist.

How?  The University of Missouri consistently use sites/services like <a href=\"https://crt.sh/\">crt.sh</a> to watch for new ssl certs that have been generated for our organizations, and sites like <a href=\"https://domainpunch.com/premium/wordmon.php\">domainpunch.com</a> to monitor domains that are being registered using one of our trademarks.  Attackers have access to these same tools, and watch for new domains.  They can then target those sites and try to begin the installation process before the site owner. But how can we use this same attack vector on an existing site?  That&#8217;s exactly how the researcher of last week&#8217;s WooCommerce Extra Product Options plugin disclosure <a href=\"http://wphutte.com/woocommerce-extra-product-options-rce-exploit-with-stored-xss-2/\">approached his research</a>. By looking for (and finding) an arbitrary file deletion vulnerability, he then can delete the wp-config file which allows him to go through the WordPress set-up stage again, ultimately taking over the site. I strongly encourage you to read his post.</p>\n<p>In a similar vein, the researcher behind several disclosures back in April <a href=\"https://blogs.akamai.com/2017/08/larrys-cabinet-of-web-vulnerability-curiosities.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+TheAkamaiBlog+%28The+Akamai+Blog%29\">reveals</a> how he approached and found vulnerabilities in multiple WordPress plugins.  Again, if security research is of interest to you, I highly recommend you read his post.</p>\n<h2>Other Security News</h2>\n<p>For those of you who may be using or supporting <a href=\"https://www.phpbb.com\">phpBB</a>, make sure you are on the latest version (<a href=\"https://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=14&amp;t=2430926\">3.2.1 &#8211; released July 17, 2017</a>) as the disclosure behind the Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability was <a href=\"http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/Aug/7\">released today</a>.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/plugins/"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/security/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"a78dc40f-e485-545e-9494-551b0addc598","wordpress_id":13687,"slug":"vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-july-28-2017","path":"/blog/2017/07/vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-july-28-2017/","author":[{"id":"5be72c28-6949-53f8-b212-3feb5a9983de","path":"gilzow","display_name":"Paul Gilzow","email":"gilzowp@missouri.edu","twitter":"gilzow","website":"http://missouri.edu/","company":"University of Missouri","company_position":"Programmer Analyst","bio":"Web application security and accessibility evangelist.

At the time, the plugin was removed from the public repository. The author has since released a fix, but the fix doesn&#8217;t entirely resolve the issue.  Unfortunately, they are relying on the reported file type ($_FILES[&#8216;fileupload&#8217;][&#8216;type&#8217;]) but this value isn&#8217;t reliable as it is set by the browser and can therefore be altered.  To the author&#8217;s credit, they are now adding <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/function.mt-rand.php\">mt_rand</a> to the file name and are now storing it in the <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/function.sys-get-temp-dir.php\">system temp directory</a>.  This does makes the uploaded file less accessible but unfortunately doesn&#8217;t truly restrict the file types being uploaded.  This vulnerability could be combined with a Local File Inclusion vulnerability to regain access to the uploaded files.  In addition, it appears that the script allows unauthorized users to generate an email and will attach the uploaded files to the email it generates, meaning an attacker could upload a payload for outlook and have the script email it to the victim.</p>\n<p><a class=\"button expand\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zTfpdEKzquGdk6y7lztnt0E18yZLe_8hH5V1AFN4474/edit?usp=sharing\">View this week&#8217;s vulnerable plugin list.</a></p>\n<h2>Other Security News</h2>\n<p>If you are using <a href=\"https://www.joomla.org/\">Joomla!</a> and are still on version 3.7.3 or earlier, you should strongly consider updating to <a href=\"https://www.joomla.org/announcements/release-news/5710-joomla-3-7-4-release.html\">3.7.4</a> (released earlier this week) as it addresses a <a href=\"https://vuldb.com/?id.104509\">Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability</a> contained in the older versions.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/plugins/"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/security/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"8e69c727-f391-51f6-9aa1-bb71cd5fc534","wordpress_id":13205,"slug":"vulnerable-plugins-report-july-13-2017","path":"/blog/2017/07/vulnerable-plugins-report-july-13-2017/","author":[{"id":"5be72c28-6949-53f8-b212-3feb5a9983de","path":"gilzow","display_name":"Paul Gilzow","email":"gilzowp@missouri.edu","twitter":"gilzow","website":"http://missouri.edu/","company":"University of Missouri","company_position":"Programmer Analyst","bio":"Web application security and accessibility evangelist.

The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/formcraft-form-builder/\">version in the public repository</a> definitely contains the vulnerability, but its directory is named &#8220;formcraft-form-builder&#8221;.  <a href=\"http://formcraft-wp.com/\">FormCraft</a> also offers a <a href=\"https://codecanyon.net/item/formcraft-premium-wordpress-form-builder/5335056?ref=ncrafts\">premium paid version</a> but as best I can tell, its directory is named &#8220;formcraft3&#8221;. It&#8217;s possible there is yet another &#8220;basic&#8221; version, but I have not been able to locate it so far.  In either case, the vulnerability is definitely present in the public version.  Given the last update was seven months ago, you might consider looking into alternative form builders as a replacement.</p>\n<p>The other plugin I want to bring attention to is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-statistics/\">WP Statistics</a> which also contained a SQL Injection vulnerability (<a href=\"https://blog.sucuri.net/2017/06/sql-injection-vulnerability-wp-statistics.html\">disclosed</a> by <a href=\"https://sucuri.net/\">Sucuri</a> earlier today).  The developer released an update to correct the issue so it is strongly encouraged that you update as soon as possible.</p>\n<p><a class=\"button expand\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sMEXTbouFWLQZgU31DKMION-iuadrfBlAqBOuizCji0/edit?usp=sharing\">View this week’s vulnerable plugins list</a></p>\n<h2>Other Security News</h2>\n<p>A <a href=\"http://www.digitalcitizensalliance.org/clientuploads/directory/Reports/DigitalCitizens_CollegeInfoTheft.pdf\">report</a> from the <a href=\"http://www.digitalcitizensalliance.org/\">Digital Citizens Alliance</a> was released back in March titled <em>Cyber Criminals, College Credentials, and the Dark Web: A Security Challenge Facing U.S. University Communities</em>. It has been on my &#8220;to-read&#8221; list for awhile and I finally had an opportunity to dig into it.  Researchers tracked how many *.edu accounts from the top 300 Higher Education Institutions were available for sale on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_web\">Dark Web</a>.</p>\n<p>Note: before you read the report, you need to take some of the information with a grain of salt. The numbers they present were gathered over a period of eight years, and none of the credentials have been verified for authenticity.  In terms of selling credentials on the dark web, we&#8217;re dealing with criminals here.  It would not be outside the realm of possibility for them to throw in some fake credentials to pad what they&#8217;re selling.</p>\n<p>As I have mentioned before, the .edu domain is extremely valuable to attackers as the domain is limited in who can use them.  *.edu credentials are particularly valuable as many companies offer students discounts on products and verify their student status through a *.edu email address.  Even more important, a *.edu credential opens the doors into a university&#8217;s network.  From there they can target the university&#8217;s internal infrastructure as well as classified and proprietary research data.</p>\n<p>We (<a href=\"http://missouri.edu/\">University of Missouri</a>) made it to #76 with 34K credentials, and a ratio of 75% (available credentials to current student + staff + faculty numbers).</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-13145\" src=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/wp-content/uploads/image001.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"548\" height=\"74\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-13146\" src=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/wp-content/uploads/image003.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"509\" height=\"27\" /></p>\n<p>As I mentioned above, these credentials have not been verified, so that number may very well be greatly inflated. However, even if only 10% are legitimate, that&#8217;s 3,400 credentials. That&#8217;s still a lot of entry points into our systems.  I would certainly encourage you to read the report, see where you rank and then use it to begin conversations with the various groups on your campus.</p>\n<h2>Dorkbot</h2>\n<p>The other item I want to mention is the <a href=\"https://security.utexas.edu/dorkbot\">Dorkbot</a> program out of the <a href=\"https://www.utexas.edu/\">University of Texas at Austin</a>.  We&#8217;ve been working with them for a couple of weeks and I have been <strong>extremely</strong> impressed with the results.  The service crawls your publicly available web presence (after you sign up, and with your permission) for vulnerabilities, and then sends a notice to your campus/institution&#8217;s Information Security Officer.  They have helped us identify numerous vulnerable applications that we were unaware of, and have been able to go back and remediate.  If your institution is not already a participant, I highly recommend you talk to your institution&#8217;s security office about joining their program.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/plugins/"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/security/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"cf194985-16da-514b-9fbf-7701122324eb","wordpress_id":12921,"slug":"vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-6-23-2017","path":"/blog/2017/06/vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-6-23-2017/","author":[{"id":"5be72c28-6949-53f8-b212-3feb5a9983de","path":"gilzow","display_name":"Paul Gilzow","email":"gilzowp@missouri.edu","twitter":"gilzow","website":"http://missouri.edu/","company":"University of Missouri","company_position":"Programmer Analyst","bio":"Web application security and accessibility evangelist.

In this case, it gives the user the ability to potentially read any file the (web host) site user account has access to.  This could be other files stored in the host account outside of the WordPress installation, other accounts files (if the host hasn&#8217;t isolated accounts from each other properly), all the way to the system passwd file.</p>\n<p><a class=\"button expand\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dZhEAHmIe9FzbcNiDZy2UCTMuhFfT04KopC8dJGiIlM/edit?usp=sharing\">View this week&#8217;s vulnerable plugins list</a></p>\n<h2>Other Security News</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://apache.org/\">Apache</a> released version 2.4.26 of the <a href=\"https://httpd.apache.org/\">Apache Web Server</a> earlier this week which addressed several critical vulnerabilities: <a href=\"https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/f4515e580dfb6eeca589a5cdebd4c4c709ce632b12924f343c3b7751@%3Cdev.httpd.apache.org%3E\">mod_mime buffer overread</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/55a068b6a5eec0b3198ae7d96a7cb412352d0ffa7716612c5af3745b@%3Cdev.httpd.apache.org%3E\">ap_find_token buffer overread</a>, and <a href=\"https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/8409e41a8f7dd9ded37141c38df001be930115428c3d64f70bbdb8b4@%3Cdev.httpd.apache.org%3E\">ap_get_basic_auth_pw authentication bypass</a> and <a href=\"https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/84bf7fcc5cad35d355f11839cbdd13cbc5ffc1d34675090bff0f96ae@%3Cdev.httpd.apache.org%3E\">mod_ssl null pointer dereference</a>. Users of 2.4.X are strongly encouraged to upgrade to 2.4.6.  These vulnerabilities also affect the 2.2.X branch and are encouraged to either apply patches to address each vulnerability, or upgrade to 2.2.33 as soon as it is released.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://securityweekly.com/2017/06/20/tsw6/\">Episode number six</a> of <a href=\"https://securityweekly.com/category/tsw/\">Tradecraft Security Weekly</a> covers finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in a WordPress site using <a href=\"https://wpscan.org/\">WPScan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.metasploit.com/\">Metasploit</a> (both of which are included in <a href=\"https://www.blackarch.org/\">BlackArch</a> which I discussed <a href=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/2017/06/vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-6-16-2017/\">last week</a>). It&#8217;s definitely worth a watch/listen if you are interested in WordPress security.</p>\n<p>For our Drupal friends, Drupal <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/SA-CORE-2017-003\">released an update </a>for both the 7.X and 8.X branches that addresses one critical vulnerability (remote code execution), one moderately critical vulnerability (access bypass for uploaded files) and one less critical vulnerability. Administrators are encouraged to update as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>Last, I&#8217;m excited to see that <a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/\">Wordfence</a> has <a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2017/06/abandoned-removed-plugin-alerts/\">added</a> a Removed Plugin alert to their security plugin (though they are <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/no-longer-in-directory/\">not the first</a> to offer this service). I have always been of the opinion that WordPress should notify you when you are using a plugin that is no longer available in the public repository (though the WordPress core team <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/ideas/topic/alert-when-installed-plugins-have-been-removed-from-the-plugin-directory/page/2#post-30439\">disagrees</a>).  Currently, if you are using a plugin in your site that has been removed from the public repository, for any reason, as the site owner you do not receive a notification of any kind. This means you could be running a plugin that has an actively exploited vulnerability, or a plugin that has been abandoned.  As an administrator you <strong>need</strong> to know when a plugin&#8217;s status has changed so you can make an informed decision about what to do.  It&#8217;s one of the main reasons why I started the vulnerable plugins report to begin with: so site owners have <em>some</em> indication of when a plugin they are using has an issue.  Given Wordfence&#8217;s install base, I applaud Wordfence for including this information in the free version of their plugin to get this vital information out to as many people as possible.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/plugins/"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/security/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"6873bc0c-f6a1-58d2-b983-7408f4bdfd21","wordpress_id":12774,"slug":"vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-6-16-2017","path":"/blog/2017/06/vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-6-16-2017/","author":[{"id":"5be72c28-6949-53f8-b212-3feb5a9983de","path":"gilzow","display_name":"Paul Gilzow","email":"gilzowp@missouri.edu","twitter":"gilzow","website":"http://missouri.edu/","company":"University of Missouri","company_position":"Programmer Analyst","bio":"Web application security and accessibility evangelist.

He then later echoes that data back out to the browser without any escaping, leaving the code, and more importantly the user, open to <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF)\">Cross-Site Scripting</a> vulnerabilities.  An attacker could therefore combine these two vulnerabilities to steal an Admin&#8217;s session IDs on a target WordPress site.</p>\n<h2>Other News</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.blackarch.org/\">BlackArch</a> released the <a href=\"https://www.blackarch.org/downloads.html\">latest version</a> of their PentTesting toolkit yesterday.  It now contains over <a href=\"https://www.blackarch.org/tools.html\">1800 tools</a> of which are several WordPress-specific tools, including one that I&#8217;ve been playing with  recently, <a href=\"https://github.com/m4ll0k/WPSeku\">WPSeku</a>.  As a general WordPress scanning tool, I still find <a href=\"https://wpscan.org/\">WPScan</a> to contain more immediately-usable information, but WPSeku allows you to define a target file and a collection of parameters that you can then have it <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Fuzzing\">fuzz</a> against for <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection\">SQL Injection</a>, Cross-Site Scripting and Local File Inclusion vulnerabilities.  From a development standpoint, I&#8217;ve been using it to test against my own themes/plugins as a tertiary way to make sure I haven&#8217;t overlooked or missed something.  Install it locally, or grab the <a href=\"http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/blackarch.org/blackarch/ova/blackarch-linux-2016.12.24-x86_64.ova\">OVA virtual machine image</a> of BlackArch and start testing against your local development instance of your sites and see what you discover.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/plugins/"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/security/"}]}}]},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"siteName":"WPCampus: Where WordPress meets higher education"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","crumbs":{"crumb":{"path":"/blog/categories/security","text":"Security"},"parent_element":{"crumb":{"path":"/blog/categories/","text":"Categories"},"parent_element":{"crumb":{"path":"/blog/","text":"Community Blog"}}}},"category":{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","name":"Security","slug":"security","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/security"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2186475492"]}
