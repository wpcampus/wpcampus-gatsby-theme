Be sure to check out their services.</p>\n</div>\n<p>There’s a quiet dread shared by every higher education web manager.</p>\n<p>“If you take our logo away from our header,” they fear, “we’d look like every other university website out there today.”</p>\n<p>Brand differentiation in higher education is difficult. There is a “sea of sameness” when it comes to the way most colleges and universities position themselves: expert faculty, ideal location, experiential learning, a global alumni network. Sound familiar?</p>\n<p>This “sea of sameness” often bleeds into the brand’s creative expression. Many homepages could be easily replaced by any other institution’s homepage. Look familiar?</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-27189\" src=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/wp-content/uploads/universal_homepage.png\" alt=\"A list of common homepage sections\" width=\"324\" height=\"476\" /></p>\n<p>Breaking away from the “sea of sameness” is no simple task. Once you’ve moved beyond the identical examples of shiny sites sent over by your leadership team, it’s time to differentiate. Gen Z is notoriously demanding, and your website must be precision-engineered and unique. After all, it has to stand out among your competitors — and the nearly 5,000 colleges and universities in the U.S. alone.</p>\n<p><strong>Here are three ideas to help you break free.</strong></p>\n<h2>1. Move to modular design</h2>\n<p>We believe modular design will improve and help maintain higher ed websites for the long haul. In the past, institutions focused efforts on developing web pages that serve specific content needs and short-term goals. Template-based design is difficult to improve and maintain. Worse, it has contributed over time to the “sea of sameness.” These pages are typically designed with integrated functionality and complex visual design.</p>\n<p>At mStoner, we make a conscious effort to think, design, and code with greater flexibility in mind. We make functional and aesthetic web components that can recombine into a number of goal-driven experiences.</p>\n<p>The beauty of this style of modular design? Your team can easily upgrade a component that is underperforming without sacrificing the integrity of the page or the site as a whole.</p>\n<p>Modular design systems will also empower designers and content editors. Teams will make smarter decisions that don’t require huge effort. If you need to augment a page with new functionality, you can assemble existing components. And you can create new experiences without the limits of a template designed for a different purpose.</p>\n<p>By taking a modular approach at the onset of a redesign, we’re able to build a product that is flexible, adaptable, and improvable based on new institutional goals or changing user needs.</p>\n<p><em>Adapted from </em><a href=\"https://www.mstoner.com/blog/design-and-usability/three-higher-ed-design-trends-2018/\"><em>Three Higher Ed Design Trends for 2018</em></a></p>\n<h2>2. Search for answers beyond higher ed</h2>\n<p>Students, prospects and alumni don’t spend all day browsing higher ed websites. Like most people, they spend much of their time on consumer sites from Netflix to Amazon to Facebook. Their point of comparison when they first visit your site isn’t your competitors: it’s the web’s most popular sites.</p>\n<p>Get outside the “sea of sameness” by considering how your audience interacts with their favorite sites and building to those expectations. How easily can applicants start — or finish — an application? Where have you placed your search bar and how do searchers filter results? How does your design encourage prospects to get in touch?</p>\n<p>If your design isn’t built considering the implicit standards of the popular web, you’re just building another higher ed website for other higher ed designers, not for your actual audience.</p>\n<p>Need a life preserver to get out of the “sea of sameness”? Consider hiring a UX designer or consultant. These professionals bring a deep understanding of the industry. They will ask new questions and surface new insights that will help you differentiate your site. They’ll also build personas that can help you prioritize your investments.</p>\n<p>One key differentiator beloved by consumers but too rarely considered? Site search. A key platform for user satisfaction and market research, search is relied upon by some 68% of website visitors. Too often, poor site search results in quick departure from a site. Effective search — with filters, synonyms, machine learning, and more than ten blue links — makes a tremendous difference for consumers. And insights gleaned from good search analytics can help higher ed leaders understand the specific interests of visitors in their own words.</p>\n<h2>3. Find insights in your website data and experiment</h2>\n<p>Good data doesn’t necessarily mean good insight. Over seventeen years building websites for higher ed, we’ve found at mStoner that well-intentioned people with good data can still make really bad decisions.</p>\n<p>Learning to draw true insights from the right data is part of the shift from of the “sea of sameness.” It’s no longer enough to scan a high-level audience report from Google Analytics once a month. Find the <em>why</em> behind your data before you build a case. Your analytics will only help to identify existing issues: it’s your job to diagnose the cause and to generate potential solutions.</p>\n<p>For example, web managers often debate how far visitors scroll down key pages, and whether visitors need cues to help them see important content. Gaining insight on visitor scrolling behavior requires tracking scroll depth on key pages and reviewing the data to determine how visitors scroll. Equipped with this knowledge, you can make important content placement decisions that work for <em>your</em> audience instead of relying on what your peers are doing.</p>\n<p>How do you know what site improvements will move you closer to hitting or exceeding your goals? Test and experiment!</p>\n<p>You might create and test a couple of variants of key page elements, such as the color and the copy that you use for a call to action on a specific page. Deploy an A/B test to discover what combination of words and colors works together best. Based on the results of this experiment, cascade changes across the rest of your site.</p>\n<p><em>Adapted from </em><a href=\"https://www.mstoner.com/blog/strategy/four-strategies-move-edu-project-process/\"><em>Four Strategies to Move Your .edu from Project to Process</em></a></p>\n<p>Whether you’re starting to look at a new site or are just refining your existing property, swim against the current in the sea of sameness. Provide your project with a solid foundation by carefully scrutinizing your audience, technology, and brand. For an easy win, focus on the small challenges you can tackle now. Then improve incrementally over time by carefully following the (right) data. And never lose sight of who you are designing for. You’ll be swimming in new waters in no time.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9822bd00-f7fb-5566-ac1e-e000cd9b2dee","wordpress_id":169,"count":13,"name":"Sponsors","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/sponsors/"},{"id":"a3025401-433e-5124-82fd-e9ac38d13ee3","wordpress_id":170,"count":7,"name":"WPCampus 2018","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/wpcampus-2018/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"b979592b-def1-5ec7-8266-37e0436138b0","wordpress_id":26546,"slug":"meet-ddev-wpcampus-2018-sponsor","path":"/blog/2018/07/meet-ddev-wpcampus-2018-sponsor/","author":[{"id":"dbd9a054-956a-5454-93c0-d29ddf7afb05","path":"sgrandchamp","display_name":"Steven Grandchamp","email":"sgrandchamp@drud.com","twitter":"drud","website":"http://www.drud.com/","company":"Drud Technology","company_position":"CEO","bio":""}],"title":"Meet DDEV, WPCampus 2018 Sponsor","status":"publish","date":"2018-07-02T15:54:38.000Z","dateFormatted":"July 2, 2018","excerpt":"<p>This post is part of a series featuring sponsors from our WPCampus 2018 conference.

Don’t tell anyone else, but it has proven to be our favorite event of the year &#8211; and selfishly, the best professional development that we can experience ourselves. For those on our team that can’t attend, we all but require watching sessions and internal discussion about all of the learning that takes place.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://campuspress.com/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-25853\" src=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/wp-content/uploads/CampusPress-logo.png\" alt=\"CampusPress logo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"221\" srcset=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/wp-content/uploads/CampusPress-logo.png 1000w, https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/wp-content/uploads/CampusPress-logo-800x177.png 800w, https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/wp-content/uploads/CampusPress-logo-768x170.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></a></p>\n<p>And this year is shaping up to be no exception! We’re particularly excited about being on the campus of WashU (where we enjoy hosting their <a href=\"https://sites.wustl.edu/\">sites.wustl.edu</a> WordPress network).</p>\n<p>As for CampusPress, you may not know that we have been quietly hosting WordPress for schools and universities longer than anyone else. In fact, our large Edublogs network with over 4 million sites launched before WordPress.com!</p>\n<p>We also pioneered the ‘managed host’ model long before any of the other countless WordPress hosts existed. Our 13+ years of experience and expertise in Multisite at scale arguably can’t be matched.</p>\n<p>But, to be fair, there have been some valid downsides to our hosting model over the years, particularly as WordPress has changed and needs have grown with many of our higher ed customers. In short, we have developed a reputation for being less flexible with developer access than some would like. To some extent, this has been by design historically, to guarantee the reliability and security of sites we host.</p>\n<p>To that end, we’ve been listening and investing heavily, and that’s why at WPCampus we’d love to chat about our <a href=\"https://campuspress.com/blog/new-dedicated-and-private-clusters-now-available/\">new dedicated cluster environments</a> and other measures that we now have in place to be more developer friendly, while keeping to our same high standards as before.</p>\n<p>With our improved flexibility, we continue to be the solution for self-service WordPress Multisite platforms for faculty, staff, and student sites and blogs. We also see more and more networks being launched to serve ePortfolios and direct classroom use (with our Canvas and LTI integrations).</p>\n<p>And more recently, we have a growing number of main and other mission-critical university websites under our guidance, which we’re incredibly excited about.</p>\n<p>In short, if it can be done with WordPress, we can support it, host it, and at any scale.</p>\n<p>We hope to see you in St. Louis!</p>\n<p><a class=\"wpc-button wpc-button--expand\" href=\"https://campuspress.com/\">Learn more about CampusPress</a></p>\n<div class=\"wpc-callout wpc-callout--primary\"><a href=\"https://2018.dev5290.wpcampus.org/\">WPCampus 2018</a> will take place July 12-14, 2018 on the campus of Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri.

Those values foster a unique kinship with our partners and clients in academia, which promote similar ideals, through education, research, and open collaboration. It’s no wonder that so many of 10up’s leaders have worked in higher education, including our Chief Executive Officer, John Eckman—a former professor <a href=\"https://2018.dev5290.wpcampus.org/schedule/what-do-other-cms-offer-higher-education/\">who is speaking at this year’s WPCampus</a>.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re gratified to include several academic institutions in our portfolio, from an early HighEdWeb award-winning project for Bates College, to projects of all shapes and sizes for renowned universities like Northeastern, Stanford, UC Davis, and Harvard, to name just a few.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-25556 aligncenter\" src=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/wp-content/uploads/10up-image2-800x457.png\" alt=\"A screenshot of eCorner.

Many universities maintain multiple WordPress sites, often using network (multisite) mode to segregate departments, in addition to one off installations for microsites. Distributor can keep a single piece of content—like an event or course description or professor’s biography—synchronized across multiple sites and departments. During our beta period, we’ve accepted dozens of applicants applying and extending it to higher education.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-25555 aligncenter\" src=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/wp-content/uploads/10up-image1-800x486.png\" alt=\"A screenshot of the WordPress admin for a project for World Park Explorer.\" width=\"800\" height=\"486\" srcset=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/wp-content/uploads/10up-image1-800x486.png 800w, https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/wp-content/uploads/10up-image1-768x467.png 768w, https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/wp-content/uploads/10up-image1-600x365.png 600w, https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/wp-content/uploads/10up-image1.png 928w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>Come find us at WPCampus and discuss the intersection of open source and Higher Education.</p>\n<div class=\"wpc-callout wpc-callout--primary\">\n<p><a href=\"https://2018.dev5290.wpcampus.org/\">WPCampus 2018</a> will take place July 12-14, 2018 on the campus of Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri.

Be sure to check out their services and say hi to them in St. Louis.</p>\n</div>\n<p>The internet was born on university campuses. It started with an &#8220;Interface Message Processor&#8221; (essentially a router) built and housed on the campus of UCLA. It was the first node of a new network.</p>\n<p>On October 29th, 1969 the first message was sent to another node built at the Stanford Research Institute. The first message consisted of just two letters, &#8220;LO&#8221;, the beginning of the word &#8220;LOGIN&#8221;, because the system crashed. An hour later they tried again and it worked. If you haven’t <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/this-is-the-room-where-the-internet-was-born-1527205592\">read the origin story of the internet</a>, it’s a fascinating read.</p>\n<p>Without the technical and academic innovation that happens behind the walls of higher education institutions, the world would be a very different place. And without events like WPCampus focusing on WordPress as it pertains to use within Higher Education, SiteLock wouldn’t have the opportunity to share our passion for technology and education.</p>\n<h2>Supporting Current and Future Generations of Technologists</h2>\n<p>At SiteLock, we’re extremely passionate about giving back to the communities where we live and work. We are especially dedicated to supporting STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) programs for schools in need.</p>\n<p>In 2015, SiteLock established the <a href=\"https://wpdistrict.sitelock.com/blog/sitelock-digital-kids-fund-2017-recap/\">Digital Kids Fund</a> to help support technology-based projects at local schools in Arizona and in 2016, we partnered with DonorsChoose.org, an organization that makes it easy for anyone to help a classroom in need, to fund STEM-related projects in schools located in the Phoenix, Arizona and Jacksonville, Florida areas.  We donated a total of $50k, which supported 198 projects and benefitted 19,992 students at 141 schools.</p>\n<p>In 2017, we continued our partnership with <a href=\"https://www.donorschoose.org/\">DonorsChoose.org</a>, but increased our total donation to $60k and included an employee gift card program! Every SiteLock employee was given a $25 gift card to support a STEM-related project in the Phoenix and Jacksonville areas. In total, our donations have supported 234 projects benefiting 30,952 students at 184 schools!</p>\n<h2>Who We Are</h2>\n<p>If you’re not already familiar with SiteLock, we are a global website security company protecting over 12 million websites worldwide, with over 4 million of those sites powered by WordPress. SiteLock delivers a 360-degree website security solution to find, fix and prevent malware and other threats from affecting websites and their visitors.</p>\n<p>Founded in 2008, the SiteLock cloud-based suite of products includes automatic file and database malware scanning and removal, automated security patching, an advanced web application firewall, static application security testing, PCI compliance and website acceleration powered by a global CDN.</p>\n<h2>Supporting the Community at Large</h2>\n<p>In 2016, we launched our popular “Secure Your Word” campaign to help promote WordPress security. Today, “Secure Your Word” branded shirts are a fixture at WordPress events worldwide. SiteLock has been a global community sponsor and remains committed to sponsoring individual WordCamps and other WordPress-focused events in 2018. It’s all part of our goal of <a href=\"https://wpdistrict.sitelock.com/blog/fostering-the-wordpress-community-we-want/\">Fostering the WordPress Community</a> as a whole.</p>\n<p>Not only is the company passionate about the WordPress mission of “Democratizing Publishing,” but you’ll also find members of the SiteLock team sharing their own WordPress experience through speaking opportunities. In fact, our own Jamie Schmid will be leading the <a href=\"https://2018.dev5290.wpcampus.org/schedule/content-strategy-workshop/\">Building a solid foundation: Introduction to content strategy</a> workshop and we’re an official sponsor of WPCampus.</p>\n<p>But it’s not just about sharing knowledge with others, it’s also about listening to the needs of users and businesses within the community, and leveraging these experiences and resources to create solutions that address specific needs. That’s why <a href=\"https://blog.sitelock.com/2017/12/smart-plus/\">SiteLock announced its new SMART®PLUS&#x2122; product</a> during WordCamp U.S. in December of 2017.</p>\n<h2>Website Security Innovation with SMART®PLUS&#x2122;</h2>\n<p>Similar to how the SiteLock SMART&#x2122; and INFINITY&#x2122; scans automatically find and remove malware in a website file structure, <a href=\"https://blog.sitelock.com/2017/12/smart-plus/\">SMART PLUS</a> extends the company’s automatic malware identification and removal abilities to include automated vulnerability patching for the core files of popular content management systems (CMS), as well as automated WordPress database scanning and cleaning.</p>\n<p>SMART PLUS also provides the ability to identify and automatically remove spam comments, and can be customized in order to filter specific keywords and phrases that matter to you. This saves valuable time from the generally tedious task of reviewing and maintaining the cleanliness and quality of the comments included within your content.</p>\n<h2>We Can’t Wait to Meet You in Person!</h2>\n<p>We’re excited to be a Graduate level sponsor for WPCampus 2018 and welcome you to stop by our table, say hello and learn more about how we protect websites. Oh yeah, and don’t forget to get your own &#8220;Secure Your Word&#8221; t-shirt!</p>\n<div class=\"wpc-callout wpc-callout--primary\">\n<p><a href=\"https://2018.dev5290.wpcampus.org/\">WPCampus 2018</a> will take place July 12-14, 2018 on the campus of Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri.
