Instead, RC1 will now be released on the 19th.  While I would personally like to see this pushed back even further (until next year), this at least gets us past Thanksgiving, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday.</p>\n<p>A second bit of good news came out earlier this week when the core team <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/11/07/classic-editor-plugin-support-window/\">announced</a> they will support the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/\">Classic Editor plugin</a> until December 31, 2021.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Classic Editor plugin will be officially supported until <strong>December 31, 2021</strong>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>While I applaud the core team for committing to long-term support of the Classic Editor plugin, it still doesn&#8217;t address the continued accessibility issues with Gutenberg. If Gutenberg is the future, then we need to make sure it is accessible to <em>everyone</em>. To aid organizations (Higher Education in particular) in the evaluation of adopting Gutenberg, WPCampus is now <a href=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/2018/10/gutenberg-a11y-audit-rfp/\">accepting proposals</a> from accessibility testing vendors to audit the Gutenberg editor. Results from the audit will be published to the WPCampus site.  The deadline for proposal submission is November 14. If you currently work with an accessibility testing vendor, we would greatly appreciate you letting them know of our RFP.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/plugins/"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/security/"},{"id":"7b9f7495-e01f-52fb-8211-386c845eb899","wordpress_id":82,"count":4,"name":"Themes","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/themes/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"eacde366-7114-5a6e-af31-992ad3cbd4a0","wordpress_id":30257,"slug":"vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-for-the-weeks-of-october-20-through-november-2-2018","path":"/blog/2018/11/vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-for-the-weeks-of-october-20-through-november-2-2018/","author":[{"id":"5be72c28-6949-53f8-b212-3feb5a9983de","path":"gilzow","display_name":"Paul Gilzow","email":"gilzowp@missouri.edu","twitter":"gilzow","website":"http://missouri.edu/","company":"University of Missouri","company_position":"Programmer Analyst","bio":"Web application security and accessibility evangelist.

My advice is still the same as it was on <a href=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/2018/10/vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-for-the-week-of-october-5-2018/\">October 5</a>: install the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/\">Classic Editor plugin</a>, install WordPress 5.0 when it is released, and then disable auto-updates while monitoring core announcements for security updates. The one change from then is the WPCampus community has put out an <a href=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/2018/10/gutenberg-a11y-audit-rfp/\">RFP for an accessibility audit on Gutenberg</a>, so I would suggest <a href=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/get-involved/\">joining the WPCampus slack workspace</a> to stay up-to-date as the audit progresses and to see the results. From there, you&#8217;ll have a much better idea as to whether or not you can implement Gutenberg on your campus.</p>\n<p>And I&#8217;m not the only one making this suggestion. The web team at NC State University has <a href=\"https://design.oit.ncsu.edu/2018/10/24/gutenberg-accessibility/\">released a similar suggestion</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>1. Before November 19, install and activate the Classic Editor plugin.<br />\n2. Upgrade to WordPress 5.0.<br />\n3. After January 17, review the results of the WPCampus accessibility audit.</p>\n<p>The results of the WPCampus audit will give everyone a good starting point for deciding what comes next.</p></blockquote>\n<p>November is setting up to be a very interesting time in the WordPress world.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/plugins/"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/security/"},{"id":"7b9f7495-e01f-52fb-8211-386c845eb899","wordpress_id":82,"count":4,"name":"Themes","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/themes/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"87dd2c6d-84d1-5185-8b38-aa61b5a2d86b","wordpress_id":25060,"slug":"vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-for-the-week-of-june-1-2018","path":"/blog/2018/06/vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-for-the-week-of-june-1-2018/","author":[{"id":"5be72c28-6949-53f8-b212-3feb5a9983de","path":"gilzow","display_name":"Paul Gilzow","email":"gilzowp@missouri.edu","twitter":"gilzow","website":"http://missouri.edu/","company":"University of Missouri","company_position":"Programmer Analyst","bio":"Web application security and accessibility evangelist.
