For WPCampus 2019, <a href=\"https://www.dev5290.wpcampus.org/blog/2019/06/donate-and-help-wpcampus-support-digital-inclusion/\">we raised $3,000 for Free Geek in Portland, Oregon</a>.</p>\n<p>For <a href=\"https://2020.dev5290.wpcampus.org\">WPCampus 2020 Online</a>, we decided to recognize and support the vital #BlackLivesMatter movement and those struggling with COVID-19. We chose five organizations and asked community members and conference attendees to <a href=\"https://2020.dev5290.wpcampus.org/donate/\" aria-label=\"submit matching donations for WPCampus 2020 online\">submit matching donations</a>.</p>\n<p>With a goal of $3,000 in matched donations, we received $2,340 in submissions. Among our trivia and door prize winners, ten elected to donate their winnings towards a selected organization. These donations increased the total amount by $200. We divided the remaining $460 (towards our $3,000 goal) among the organizations.</p>\n<p>While we didn&#8217;t quite reach our goal of $3,000 in matched donations, the WPCampus organization donated $3,000 and overall helped to raise $5,340. We consider the campaign a great success!</p>\n<p>Here are the numbers donated to each organization. We invite you to <a href=\"https://2020.dev5290.wpcampus.org/donate/\">learn more about each organization</a> and continue to contribute to their cause.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Black Girls Code:</strong> $507 from WPCampus, $882 overall</li>\n<li><strong>Black Lives Matter:</strong> $817 from WPCampus, $1502 overall</li>\n<li><strong>Feeding America:</strong> $327 from WPCampus, $522 overall</li>\n<li><strong>NAACP Legal Defense Fund:</strong> $1,062 from WPCampus. $2,012 overall</li>\n<li><strong>The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU):</strong> $287 from WPCampus, $422 overall</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thank you to all who donated. WPCampus is a community before its a conference. We are humans before we are web professionals. One of our organizational pillars will always be to do what we can to support and care for each other.</p>\n<p>As a side note: we are publishing session recordings from the conference as soon as they are processed. The first one available is an excellent presentation from Joe Dolson: &#8220;Update on the Gutenberg accessibility audit”: <a href=\"https://2020.dev5290.wpcampus.org/schedule/update-on-gutenberg-accessibility-audit/#video\">https://2020.dev5290.wpcampus.org/schedule/update-on-gutenberg-accessibility-audit/#video</a></p>\n<p>Check the <a href=\"https://2020.dev5290.wpcampus.org/schedule/\">WPCampus 2020 schedule</a> often for new recordings.

You can <a href=\"https://2020.dev5290.wpcampus.org/register/\">register for WPCampus 2020 Online</a> on the event website. Registration is required to access the event.

This will be the final change.</p>\n<p>The first time we changed our dates, it was <a href=\"https://www.dev5290.wpcampus.org/blog/2020/05/wpcampus-2020-online-to-change-dates/\">because of a conflict with DrupalCon</a>. This time the reason is more personal. To put it simply, we’ve been listening to feedback and feel a three-day event with a half-day of workshops and two days of lectures would be a bit too much for everyone, including organizers and attendees.</p>\n<p>We decided to remove workshops and set the event for two days on Wednesday (July 29), and Thursday (July 30). By leaving Friday open, we hope that attendees will be more likely to focus on the event because they can use Friday to get caught up on work before the weekend.</p>\n<p>We want to allow everyone to enjoy our time together. When you attend our event in-person, you’re physically separated from your work environment. While responsibilities and distractions inevitably pop up, the physical distance makes it easier to focus on learning and networking. Achieving this work boundary is more of a struggle in an online environment.</p>\n<p>We recognize that while attending an online event, you’ll most likely be sitting at your workstation. We want to be mindful of your time and duration of online activity. We want to foster opportunities where you’re more likely to detach from work and focus on your professional development.</p>\n<h2>Introducing initiative for recurring workshops</h2>\n<p>We know the value workshops and similar extended session formats can bring to learn more about a specific topic. We do not want to remove this value from our community.</p>\n<p>Instead of limiting workshops to our conferences, we’re introducing an initiative to host recurring workshops, seminars, or classes throughout the year, hopefully monthly or bi-monthly. We’re excited by the opportunity for increased professional development, networking, and time we can spend together.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in driving this initiative forward, we have published a few surveys and would love your feedback. We’re also looking for topics and presenters.</p>\n<p><a class=\"wpc-button wpc-button--primary wpc-button--larger\" href=\"https://www.dev5290.wpcampus.org/community/surveys/workshops/\">Complete the WPCampus workshop surveys</a></p>\n<h2>WPCampus is matching donations</h2>\n<p>One of our WPCampus traditions is to use the “previously allocated to swag” portion of our event income to support a nonprofit organization.

The first submission of the year will receive a WPCampus Care package, including stickers, coasters, and other swag from the WPCampus archives. Plus a shout-out on our Twitter account. One more reason to start that brainstorming early!</p>\n<h2>Session Formats</h2>\n<p>Over the years, we&#8217;ve continued to experiment with our program and aim to provide a variety of formats:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>General lecture sessions\n<ul>\n<li>45 minute lectures on various topics with 1-2 presenters.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Panel discussions\n<ul>\n<li>45 minute discussion on a specific topic with a facilitator and a panel of experts.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Group discussions\n<ul>\n<li>45 minute group discussions on a specific topic.</li>\n<li>The discussion is had among all in attendance and led by a facilitator.</li>\n<li>The facilitator is selected by the planning committee but the community selects the topics.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Hands-on workshops\n<ul>\n<li>A few 2-4 hour hands-on workshop time slots are available.</li>\n<li>Workshops will be held a day early.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Lightning talks\n<ul>\n<li>A 10-15 minute presentation for a quick overview of a specific topic.</li>\n<li>Our lightning talks are viewed by all attendees.

The event will cover a variety of topics, all focused on the growth of Higher Education, Accessibility, WordPress, and its people.</p>\n<h2>A new schedule</h2>\n<p>In the past, our event has taken place Thursday through Saturday, but we listened to your feedback and moved our program to Wednesday through Friday.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re excited about this change and what it means for the event. The new program will give in-person attendees more time to visit New Orleans over the weekend before they return home.</p>\n<p>We also noticed a drop off of live stream viewers on Saturday so we hope this change will allow our virtual attendees to enjoy the entire program during their workday.</p>\n<h2>An amazing city</h2>\n<p>New Orleans is a beautiful and lively city that we can&#8217;t wait to explore it with our community. We&#8217;re on the lookout for social and networking events. Our Slack is already filled with discussions of cooking classes, historic tours, and the best places to eat.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve never been to New Orleans, we can&#8217;t recommend it enough. We hope you can join us and experience the fun for yourself.</p>\n<h2>What to expect</h2>\n<p>While the format of our event is similar to a WordCamp, our entire program is focused on Higher Education and Accessibility, which allows for a richer and more fine-tuned experience for our attendees.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll never want to miss a session because they&#8217;re tailored just for you, a web professional who builds WordPress websites for Higher Education. Take advantage of face-to-face discussions with fellow attendees who also know what it’s like to build websites in Higher Ed.</p>\n<p>Share with, learn from, and be inspired by, your peers.</p>\n<p>The schedule isn’t finalized but you can <a href=\"https://2020.dev5290.wpcampus.org/schedule/\">visit the schedule page</a> to know what to expect, especially for those who will be joining us for the first time in New Orleans.</p>\n<p>For those who can’t make the trip, we expect to continue our tradition of live streaming our sessions.</p>\n<p>To learn more about the content we provide, you can access recordings from past events in the <a href=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/library/\">WPCampus Learning Library</a> or on the <a href=\"https://2019.dev5290.wpcampus.org/schedule/\">WPCampus 2019 website</a>.</p>\n<h2>On-campus lodging</h2>\n<p>We’re excited to offer on-campus housing again for this year’s event, which really helps to keep travel costs low. We’ll post information as soon as its available.</p>\n<h2>Become a speaker</h2>\n<p>If you’d like to speak at the event, be on the lookout for our call for proposals!</p>\n<p>Accepted speakers receive free admission and hordes of gratefulness and admiration for your investment in Higher Education. Also, swag.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://2020.dev5290.wpcampus.org/speakers/\">Visit our speakers page</a> to learn about topic ideas, session formats, and more.</p>\n<h2>Become a sponsor</h2>\n<p>Your support helps provide an affordable experience for our members and gives you access to a large number of Higher Education institutions from across North America and Europe.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in sponsoring our event, please let us know by filling out <a href=\"https://2020.dev5290.wpcampus.org/sponsors/#interest\">our sponsor interest form</a>.
