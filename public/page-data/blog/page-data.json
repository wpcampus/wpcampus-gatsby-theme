And our planning methods became less effective. It&#8217;s time to try something new in how WPCampus organizes and fosters our community, its events, and its initiatives.</p>\n<h2>TL;DR</h2>\n<p>From now on, the WPCampus community will post all planning activity, announcements, requests for feedback, decisions, and anything else related to planning our organization&#8217;s growth to the new WPCampus Planning Blog.</p>\n<p>The WPCampus Slack #planning channel will continue to be our home for planning-related discussion. WPCampus members will use the #planning channel to share and discuss the Planning Blog. All requests for planning-related feedback will go through the Planning Blog. All public planning meetings that took place in the #planning channel have been canceled indefinitely.</p>\n<p>You can now <a href=\"http://eepurl.com/hppn0T\">subscribe</a> to Planning Blog email updates to stay informed of new posts.</p>\n<p>Please read the first Planning Blog post announcing our <a href=\"https://www.dev5290.wpcampus.org/community/planning/call-for-wpcampus-2021-organizers/\">Call for WPCampus 2021 organizers</a>. And be on the lookout for an upcoming survey looking for WPCampus 2021 feedback.</p>\n<p>Keep reading if you&#8217;re interested in the history of our planning methods, the lessons we learned, a deeper dive into how the new Planning Blog will work, and how to stay involved with planning our community.</p>\n<h2>The history of WPCampus planning</h2>\n<p>A vital component of our planning process has always been the <a href=\"https://wordcampus.slack.com/archives/C09KVRH28\">WPCampus Slack workspace #planning channel</a>. This channel has been home to all public community planning conversations.</p>\n<p>Public planning meetings take place directly within the #planning Slack channel. Depending on the time of year and how close we are to hosting a WPCampus event, planning meetings would take place weekly or bi-weekly. Any members interested in helping plan our community events and initiatives may join the meetings to provide feedback, suggest ideas, and participate in voting via emoji. </p>\n<p>WPCampus committees (like the planning committee for a specific conference) and other working groups tend to have private discussions but share their efforts and updates, and ask for feedback, via the #planning channel.</p>\n<p>At any time, the #planning channel is a great place to post questions and notes and discuss, develop, and foster ideas—allowing members to provide feedback at will.</p>\n<p>If the conversation there seems essential, organizers share in the #general Slack channel to broaden input. We post prominent announcements to the main WPCampus blog to expand information beyond our Slack audience.</p>\n<h2>Why our planning methods became less effective</h2>\n<p>Overall, our planning method worked pretty well for the first five years of our organization. But there were small issues that grew in prominence. It became clear we need to rethink how we plan and organize our community.</p>\n<h3>Not everyone could attend the planning meeting</h3>\n<p>When you only have one planning meeting a week, this restricts who can attend and participate. We enjoy the textual format of hosting meetings in Slack so that those who cannot participate can read the transcript later and provide feedback. But because our Slack plan is free (which means our messages aren&#8217;t indefinitely archived), meeting transcripts are eventually lost.</p>\n<h3>The need to hold meetings became sporadic and hard to manage</h3>\n<p>When we are planning an event, we hold a planning meeting each week. But throughout the rest of the year, there is no need to maintain a weekly meeting. So we started holding bi-weekly meetings. If we had nothing to discuss, we would cancel the meeting. Over time, meetings&#8217; sporadic and unpredictable nature became hard to manage for organizers and attendees, and attendance noticeably dropped.</p>\n<h3>Our planning notes aren&#8217;t centrally stored and easy to find</h3>\n<p>As an organization, we use Google Drive to store our organizational notes and information, including meeting minutes, agendas, etc. As part of Slack functionality, we try to &#8220;pin&#8221; and link these documents within related Slack channels. We also try to link these documents to related pages on our website. But we don&#8217;t have an organized, central place to help members find planning information and documentation.</p>\n<h3>You have to be fairly active in Slack to keep up</h3>\n<p>Our community has always been pretty Slack-active. It&#8217;s where we get things done. But not everyone can be tuned in to Slack all day, which means you might miss a vital planning tidbit from time to time.</p>\n<h2>How we&#8217;re going to plan our community from now on</h2>\n<p>So now that we&#8217;ve learned some lessons, it&#8217;s time to try something new. And with that, we introduce the first step forward: the <a href=\"http://www.dev5290.wpcampus.org/community/planning/\">WPCampus Planning Blog</a>.</p>\n<p>From now on, we will post all planning activity, announcements, requests for feedback, decisions, and anything else related to planning our organization&#8217;s growth to the WPCampus Planning Blog.</p>\n<h3>The Planning Blog will allow for:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Planning conversations and feedback to be more asynchronous\n<ul>\n<li>Discussions and updates will not depend on our Slack #planning channel or a planning meeting</li>\n<li>You can receive planning information and respond to calls for action or surveys in your own time</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Planning discussions to expand outside the WPCampus Slack workspace\n<ul>\n<li>You can <a href=\"http://eepurl.com/hppn0T\">subscribe to the WPCampus Planning Blog newsletter</a> and receive an automated email when a new blog post is published, which means you don&#8217;t have to be active in Slack to stay informed</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Our planning notes and documentation to be more accessible\n<ul>\n<li>Publishing on the website will allow the blog to be indexed and publically searched</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The Planning Blog posts will also:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Share updates related to planning our organization and community</li>\n<li>Ask for help planning events and initiatives</li>\n<li>Share &#8220;behind the scenes&#8221; updates about events and initiatives</li>\n<li>Publish surveys to gather feedback to help leadership make decisions</li>\n<li>Publish agendas and meeting minutes for WPCampus planning committees and working groups</li>\n<li>And more!</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Who will publish to the Planning Blog?</h3>\n<p>For now, only myself and WPCampus members in a leadership position will be allowed to post to the Planning Blog. For example, you might see posts from the chair of the new WPCampus 2021 organizing committee or from Dash or Trip, the co-chairs of the Diversity and Inclusion committee.</p>\n<h3>What this means for public planning meetings</h3>\n<p>For now, all public community planning meetings have been canceled indefinitely. The Planning Blog&#8217;s goal is to foster planning-related communication and feedback without the need for meetings. We will re-introduce meetings if deemed necessary. Working groups and committees will continue to meet.</p>\n<h3>What this means for the #planning channel</h3>\n<p>The #planning channel has always been and will continue to be an excellent place for planning-related discussion. Feel free to continue to use the channel to post any planning-related ideas and foster planning-related discussion. The WPCampus Slack #planning channel will also host comments and discussions related to the Planning Blog. </p>\n<p>In the next section, <a href=\"#interact\">How to interact with the Planning Blog</a>, I discuss how to use the #planning channel going forward.</p>\n<h2 id=\"interact\">How to interact with the Planning Blog</h2>\n<h3>How to ask questions, provide feedback, and comment on blog posts</h3>\n<p>To get the blog up and running quickly, I opted to forego comments. We all know managing comments can be quite tricky. </p>\n<p>Still, <b>feedback is the most important of the planning process</b>. I will solve this issue first. </p>\n<p>For now, we will discuss the planning blog posts within the WPCampus Slack #planning channel.</p>\n<h3>If a planning blog post asks for specific feedback</h3>\n<p>If a planning blog post asks for specific feedback, the blog post will include a survey form. This method allows WPCampus members to participate more efficiently and for WPCampus leadership to measure and analyze results. When a survey is closed, we will publish the results within the Planning Blog.</p>\n<h3>If a planning blog post requires a call for action</h3>\n<p>Often, our planning efforts require assistance. For example, organizers might be looking for conference assistance or need help with web content or development. If a blog post requires a call for action, the blog post will include further instructions.</p>\n<h2>In closing: Thank you!</h2>\n<p>Publishing the WPCampus Planning Blog is the first step towards what I hope will be lots of positive and constructive change for planning our community and events. Ongoing efforts will be needed to ensure we have well organized and discoverable planning information and frequent communication and transparent processes.</p>\n<p>WPCampus governance — of both the organization and community — is important to me. I know that it currently needs and will always need improvement. I hope these changes will help us improve our community together.</p>\n<p>Thank you to all who have been a part of our planning process. So many of you show up and put in the work. You give what you can, and I am so grateful for you.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s to the future of WPCampus, eduwapuu, Truck Sheep, and all of you who contribute and participate and make our community special.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"cbc27153-ee39-57cc-8b14-d98007120136","wordpress_id":263,"count":1,"name":"Planning","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/planning/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"9165c8e1-fcfb-5f6e-ad9e-e8fd02206fee","wordpress_id":40742,"slug":"final-numbers-wpcampus-2020-online-donation-campaign","path":"/blog/2020/08/final-numbers-wpcampus-2020-online-donation-campaign/","author":[{"id":"85326174-895c-5bce-b742-ce9d51d39a56","path":"wpcampus","display_name":"WPCampus","email":"website@dev5290.wpcampus.org","twitter":"wpcampusorg","website":"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org","company":"","company_position":"","bio":"WPCampus is a community of web professionals, educators, and others dedicated to the growth of WordPress in higher education.

This will be the final change.</p>\n<p>The first time we changed our dates, it was <a href=\"https://www.dev5290.wpcampus.org/blog/2020/05/wpcampus-2020-online-to-change-dates/\">because of a conflict with DrupalCon</a>. This time the reason is more personal. To put it simply, we’ve been listening to feedback and feel a three-day event with a half-day of workshops and two days of lectures would be a bit too much for everyone, including organizers and attendees.</p>\n<p>We decided to remove workshops and set the event for two days on Wednesday (July 29), and Thursday (July 30). By leaving Friday open, we hope that attendees will be more likely to focus on the event because they can use Friday to get caught up on work before the weekend.</p>\n<p>We want to allow everyone to enjoy our time together. When you attend our event in-person, you’re physically separated from your work environment. While responsibilities and distractions inevitably pop up, the physical distance makes it easier to focus on learning and networking. Achieving this work boundary is more of a struggle in an online environment.</p>\n<p>We recognize that while attending an online event, you’ll most likely be sitting at your workstation. We want to be mindful of your time and duration of online activity. We want to foster opportunities where you’re more likely to detach from work and focus on your professional development.</p>\n<h2>Introducing initiative for recurring workshops</h2>\n<p>We know the value workshops and similar extended session formats can bring to learn more about a specific topic. We do not want to remove this value from our community.</p>\n<p>Instead of limiting workshops to our conferences, we’re introducing an initiative to host recurring workshops, seminars, or classes throughout the year, hopefully monthly or bi-monthly. We’re excited by the opportunity for increased professional development, networking, and time we can spend together.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in driving this initiative forward, we have published a few surveys and would love your feedback. We’re also looking for topics and presenters.</p>\n<p><a class=\"wpc-button wpc-button--primary wpc-button--larger\" href=\"https://www.dev5290.wpcampus.org/community/surveys/workshops/\">Complete the WPCampus workshop surveys</a></p>\n<h2>WPCampus is matching donations</h2>\n<p>One of our WPCampus traditions is to use the “previously allocated to swag” portion of our event income to support a nonprofit organization.

The event will cover a variety of topics, all focused on the growth of Higher Education, Accessibility, WordPress, and its people.</p>\n<h2>A new schedule</h2>\n<p>In the past, our event has taken place Thursday through Saturday, but we listened to your feedback and moved our program to Wednesday through Friday.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re excited about this change and what it means for the event. The new program will give in-person attendees more time to visit New Orleans over the weekend before they return home.</p>\n<p>We also noticed a drop off of live stream viewers on Saturday so we hope this change will allow our virtual attendees to enjoy the entire program during their workday.</p>\n<h2>An amazing city</h2>\n<p>New Orleans is a beautiful and lively city that we can&#8217;t wait to explore it with our community. We&#8217;re on the lookout for social and networking events. Our Slack is already filled with discussions of cooking classes, historic tours, and the best places to eat.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve never been to New Orleans, we can&#8217;t recommend it enough. We hope you can join us and experience the fun for yourself.</p>\n<h2>What to expect</h2>\n<p>While the format of our event is similar to a WordCamp, our entire program is focused on Higher Education and Accessibility, which allows for a richer and more fine-tuned experience for our attendees.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll never want to miss a session because they&#8217;re tailored just for you, a web professional who builds WordPress websites for Higher Education. Take advantage of face-to-face discussions with fellow attendees who also know what it’s like to build websites in Higher Ed.</p>\n<p>Share with, learn from, and be inspired by, your peers.</p>\n<p>The schedule isn’t finalized but you can <a href=\"https://2020.dev5290.wpcampus.org/schedule/\">visit the schedule page</a> to know what to expect, especially for those who will be joining us for the first time in New Orleans.</p>\n<p>For those who can’t make the trip, we expect to continue our tradition of live streaming our sessions.</p>\n<p>To learn more about the content we provide, you can access recordings from past events in the <a href=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/library/\">WPCampus Learning Library</a> or on the <a href=\"https://2019.dev5290.wpcampus.org/schedule/\">WPCampus 2019 website</a>.</p>\n<h2>On-campus lodging</h2>\n<p>We’re excited to offer on-campus housing again for this year’s event, which really helps to keep travel costs low. We’ll post information as soon as its available.</p>\n<h2>Become a speaker</h2>\n<p>If you’d like to speak at the event, be on the lookout for our call for proposals!</p>\n<p>Accepted speakers receive free admission and hordes of gratefulness and admiration for your investment in Higher Education. Also, swag.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://2020.dev5290.wpcampus.org/speakers/\">Visit our speakers page</a> to learn about topic ideas, session formats, and more.</p>\n<h2>Become a sponsor</h2>\n<p>Your support helps provide an affordable experience for our members and gives you access to a large number of Higher Education institutions from across North America and Europe.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in sponsoring our event, please let us know by filling out <a href=\"https://2020.dev5290.wpcampus.org/sponsors/#interest\">our sponsor interest form</a>.

However, I fully empathize with universities/organizations that have to stay with an older version due to internal policies or change management policies. This is especially true after the release of version 5.0.0 with Gutenberg.  If you use an older version, or have policies in place where you can&#8217;t immediately update to the latest major version of WordPress as soon as it is released, then <strong>I strongly encourage you to weigh in over on the policy proposal page</strong> and have your voice heard.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/plugins/"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/security/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"ef66243a-da66-5e56-9d63-f3416e667a7f","wordpress_id":36403,"slug":"vulnerable-plugins-report-for-the-week-of-august-2nd-2019","path":"/blog/2019/08/vulnerable-plugins-report-for-the-week-of-august-2nd-2019/","author":[{"id":"7f4ed30b-8e00-5331-bfb2-ed54dc0fcc41","path":"pgogy","display_name":"Pat Lockley","email":"Info@pgogywebstuff.com","twitter":"Pgogy","website":"https://pgogywebstuff.com","company":"Pgogy webstuff","company_position":"Owner","bio":"Academic technologist and pedagogic outfitter.

In early 2019, we <a href=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/2019/01/gutenberg-audit-vendor/\">announced our selection of Tenon, LLC</a> to conduct the audit, at a cost of $31,200.</p>\n<p>Today, we’re excited to release Tenon’s report on the accessibility of the new editor.</p>\n<p>This report was made possible by the extraordinary generosity of <a href=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/audit/#donors\">more than 100 members of the WordPress community</a>, who collectively contributed $10,264 to fund this project. We’re also grateful to Matt Mullenweg and Automattic, who pledged to ensure that the audit would be fully funded and are covering the balance of the cost of this effort.</p>\n<p>In addition, this audit would not be possible without the <a href=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/2019/01/gutenberg-audit-vendor/\">members of our vendor selection committee</a>. These amazing and talented people donated their time and energy to review proposals, ask smart questions, and ensure that the report we’re sharing today would be valuable to our community.</p>\n<h2>Why WPCampus commissioned a Gutenberg audit</h2>\n<p>WPCampus values accessibility. Our participants are particularly sensitive to <a href=\"https://www.section508.gov/\">their institutions’ legal obligations to provide accessible technologies</a>.</p>\n<p>Beyond those legal obligations, colleges and universities worldwide have committed to providing their communities an accessible digital experience. The uncertainty surrounding the accessibility of Gutenberg makes it difficult for institutions using WordPress to plan their transition to the new editor.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, WPCampus commissioned an accessibility audit to provide our participating institutions (and the broader WordPress community) with an independent assessment. This audit is a resource to help make informed decisions.</p>\n<h2>What was tested</h2>\n<p>Tenon began their testing of the editor in January 2019 on the most current version of WordPress at that time, version 5.0.3.</p>\n<p>WordPress versions 5.1 and 5.1.1 (released while Tenon was testing) contained updates made in Gutenberg version 4.8. These updates included <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=label%3AAccessibility+closed%3A2018-12-12..2019-01-03\">four resolved accessibility issues</a>.</p>\n<p>At the time of this writing, an <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=label%3AAccessibility+closed%3A%3E2019-01-03\">additional 116 issues related to accessibility</a> have been closed thanks to the efforts of the WordPress Accessibility Team and Gutenberg contributors. These changes are targeted for inclusion in WordPress version 5.2 in early May.</p>\n<p>Some of Tenon’s findings may overlap with many of these closed issues. This report is best understood as a snapshot of the state of the editor in early 2019, and as a reference document for measuring continuing progress toward accessibility.</p>\n<h2>How to read this report</h2>\n<p>As we prepared to publish the audit results, we had an internal discussion about how this report might be received by the broader WordPress community. We’d like to address that here.</p>\n<p>An inaccessible editing experience has real and significant consequences for many people in our community. The findings provided by Tenon are serious, and deserve to be considered with thought and care.</p>\n<p>These findings should not be used as fodder for out-of-context quotes on social media or in blog comments. Please refrain from using this report as a means to attack others.</p>\n<p>Please use this report as what it is intended to be: <strong>constructive feedback in support of the WordPress project</strong>. We hope this report generates discussion about accessibility, excitement about inclusive design, and action toward improving the editing experience.</p>\n<p>This report is valuable for anyone working on a complex user interface. Please use this report as an educational resource to help guide and assess your future projects.</p>\n<h2>Results of the accessibility audit</h2>\n<h3>Overview</h3>\n<p>Tenon has provided WPCampus with the following documents:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A 34-page <a href=\"https://documents.dev5290.wpcampus.org/gutenberg/audit/Gutenberg_Executive_Summary.pdf\">Executive Summary</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://documents.dev5290.wpcampus.org/gutenberg/audit/Gutenberg_Test_Plan.pdf\">Tenon’s testing plan</a>, which groups features of the editor into testing components</li>\n<li>A 329-page long-form <a href=\"https://documents.dev5290.wpcampus.org/gutenberg/audit/Gutenberg_Report.pdf\">technical report</a> describing the logged issues in detail</li>\n<li>A summary document describing <a href=\"https://documents.dev5290.wpcampus.org/gutenberg/audit/Gutenberg_UX_Report.pdf\">Tenon’s usability testing</a></li>\n<li>A <a href=\"https://documents.dev5290.wpcampus.org/gutenberg/audit/Gutenberg_All_Issues.csv\">CSV file containing the issues logged</a> during the technical audit</li>\n<li>A <a href=\"https://documents.dev5290.wpcampus.org/gutenberg/audit/Tenon_Audit_Report_Issue_Import_Guide.docx\">guide to importing the CSV file</a> into issue tracking tools</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To help facilitate improvements to the editor based on these findings, Tenon has created a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/created_by/karlgroves\">collection of issues on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<h3>Recommendation for site administrators (and general WordPress users)</h3>\n<p>The Executive Summary document contains the most immediately relevant information for site administrators. That document describes the findings of the audit and the potential impact of the new editor for content creators.</p>\n<p>The user-based testing report is also recommended reading. This document provides insight into the particular challenges of using the editor for some in our community. We believe this is important context for understanding the necessity of making the editor accessible.</p>\n<h3>Recommendation for WordPress core contributors and web developers</h3>\n<p>As with site administrators, we recommend web developers begin with the Executive Summary and the report from Tenon’s user-based testing. In addition, we recommend developers prioritize the long-form technical report.</p>\n<p>We encourage WordPress core contributors to review all of the audit documents provided by Tenon. This is a substantial time commitment, but will be useful in implementing the changes needed to make the editor more accessible.</p>\n<p>Further, we encourage any web developer to take the time to read and review all of the information provided in this audit. That includes developers not directly involved in the WordPress project. Tenon has compiled a wealth of information, and we’re excited to share it. Examining this report is a tremendous opportunity for professional development, and sets a standard every developer building a complex user interface should aspire to.</p>\n<h3>Recommendation for higher education institutions that use WordPress</h3>\n<p>WPCampus commissioned this audit to provide an independent assessment to institutions that use WordPress, and not to provide any specific guidance or legal advice. This information may be used to determine potential legal risk, challenges, or impact faced by using the Gutenberg editor.</p>\n<p>We recommend that your web team review the report. We also recommend that you share it with your IT accessibility office and/or your disability services office.</p>\n<p>The WPCampus Slack community is always available as a place to share ideas, concerns, and strategies.

We’re looking forward to another year of wonderful ideas, demonstrations, brainstorming, and benchmarking.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Session Topics</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As in past years, we’re looking for a variety of topics on anything that might bring value to our community. WordPress and higher education are key themes, but we want people to share on their own experiences in various arenas: accessibility, design, development, strategy, management, usability, governance, etc. Anything you’ve found valuable in contributing to higher education communities and/or the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re considering applying, but are hesitant, start by checking out our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wpcampus.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6d71860d429d3461309568b92&amp;id=969c2fdf57&amp;e=f17142f289\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Speaker Training videos</a>. If you’re having trouble finding inspiration or fleshing out ideas, these videos may help get your vision into a submittable format. And feel free to share your ideas with us for feedback!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Speaker Benefits</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Accepted speakers will receive complimentary admission (one free ticket per session) and hordes of gratefulness, admiration and superstar status for your investment in higher education.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AND, new this year, the first submission of the year will receive a WPCampus Care package, including a t-shirt, coasters, and our unconditional love and gratitude, plus a shout-out on our Twitter account. One more reason to start that brainstorming early!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Session Formats</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While the majority of sessions will be comprised of 45-minute presentations, we would love to provide a variety of formats. If standing up in a room in front of a bunch of people and talking for 45 minutes isn&#8217;t your thing, no problem! Lightning talks can be just as valuable for attendees.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><em>General Lecture Sessions</em><br>Talks will be 40 minutes with 5 minutes for questions.</li><li><em>Hands-on Workshops</em><br>A few 2-4 hour hands-on workshop time slots are available. Workshops are usually held a day early.</li><li><em>Lightning Talks</em><br>A 15-minute presentation for quick topic overviews. Our lightning talks are viewed by all attendees. We really enjoy this time together, sharing insights on various topics.</li><li><em>Panel Discussions</em><br>A 45-minute session with a facilitators and experts on a topic.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Still Undecided?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You’re still reading so you’re thinking about speaking. If you’re unsure because you don’t feel like you have anything to say, keep this in mind: the people that get up and speak aren’t always the experts. They’re just the people who said yes. You have value and insight to share and we would love for you to say yes and share your unique experiences. Your story needs to be heard.<br>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Stay tuned for the Call for Proposals announcement and we hope to see you in July!</strong></p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"95dfb001-f6cc-50d2-912e-fd2b865d62f5","wordpress_id":214,"count":13,"name":"WPCampus 2019","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/wpcampus-2019/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"cde1eb25-e5ef-5040-982e-389429b867cb","wordpress_id":34343,"slug":"vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-for-the-week-of-march-15-2019","path":"/blog/2019/03/vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-for-the-week-of-march-15-2019/","author":[{"id":"5be72c28-6949-53f8-b212-3feb5a9983de","path":"gilzow","display_name":"Paul Gilzow","email":"gilzowp@missouri.edu","twitter":"gilzow","website":"http://missouri.edu/","company":"University of Missouri","company_position":"Programmer Analyst","bio":"Web application security and accessibility evangelist.

While a good idea in theory, several have <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/concerns-raised-about-wordpress-new-white-screen-of-death-protection-feature/\">pointed</a> <a href=\"https://medium.com/websec/wordpress-serve-happy-ffd93c94f5ac\">out</a> that this feature could be abused to disable non-offending plugins, thereby bypassing security functionality.  From the make post it appears that this functionality will be enabled by default when 5.1 drops.  A new configuration option ( <code>WP_DISABLE_FATAL_ERROR_HANDLER</code> ) is available to disable this feature.  Given its possibility for abuse, I would encourage you to disable this feature except when updating/upgrading your site.</p>\n<h2>Other Security News</h2>\n<p>If you use PEAR&#8217;s package manager (go-pear.phar), and have downloaded it from the PEAR site any time over the last two months, it is <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2019/01/php-pear-hacked.html\">possible your copy is tainted</a>.  Maintainers at the PEAR repository took down the official PEAR website an then <a href=\"http://blog.pear.php.net/\">announced</a> the PEAR website had been compromised.  A clean version is available on the PEAR github site. You are encouraged to checksum your version with the clean version, or replace your copy with the known-clean version and then scan your systems.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll be joining <a href=\"https://pantheon.io/\">Pantheon</a> next Thursday (the 31st) at 12:00pm CST to discuss WordPress application security in a higher education setting.  <a href=\"https://pantheon.io/resources/january-couch-coding\">Registration is now open.</a></p>\n<h2>Other News</h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, my webinar with Pantheon just happens to be on the at the exact same day as <a href=\"https://online.dev5290.wpcampus.org/schedule/\">WPCampus Online 2019</a>, and at the exact same time as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bamadesigner\">Rachel</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BrianDeConinck\">Brian&#8217;s</a> report on the <a href=\"https://online.dev5290.wpcampus.org/schedule/wpcampus-gutenberg-accessibility-audit/\">WPCampus Gutenberg Accessibility Audit report</a>.  I strongly encourage everyone to take advantage of this free online conference as it features some incredible speakers covering a wide-range of topics (don&#8217;t miss <a href=\"https://twitter.com/arrowood\">Adam Arrowood</a>&#8216;s presentation <a href=\"https://online.dev5290.wpcampus.org/schedule/what-to-expect-when-youre-expecting-to-be-hacked-wordpress-edition/\"><em>What to expect when you’re expecting to be hacked: WordPress edition</em></a>).

Founded by Karl Groves, Tenon is a leader in the accessibility testing field. We look forward to working with the team at Tenon over the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>Thank you to all of the companies who responded to our RFP. We received some truly outstanding proposals, making this an incredibly difficult decision. We appreciate your patience while our selection committee wrestled with our choice.</p>\n<h2>Fundraising</h2>\n<p>This project is funded through our <a href=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/2018/11/fundraising-for-wpcampus-gutenberg-accessibility-audit/\">first-ever crowdfunding effort</a>. So far, WPCampus has raised over $10,000, contributed by over 100 generous individuals, organizations, and companies across the WordPress community. In addition, we are particularly grateful to <a href=\"https://automattic.com/\">Automattic and Matt Mullenweg</a>, who pledged to cover the remaining balance to fund our accessibility audit just prior to WordCamp US 2018.</p>\n<p>The final cost of the audit will be just under $31,200.</p>\n<p>We will leave the fundraising drive open until <del>Friday, February 8</del> Thursday, February 28 to allow more of the community to participate. We hope you’ll join us in this important project to ensure an accessible editing experience for all users.</p>\n<p>In addition to contributing financially, some of our donors shared <a href=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/2018/11/fundraising-for-wpcampus-gutenberg-accessibility-audit/#donors\">personal messages about why they value accessibility</a>. We encourage you to take a few minutes to read some of these messages.</p>\n<p>We deeply appreciate each and every one of you who chose to support our effort, as well as those who weren’t able to donate but helped us publicize the fundraiser. Your support is a strong statement that accessibility matters to our community.</p>\n<h2>About the Audit</h2>\n<p>The institutions that participate in WPCampus face legal obligations to provide their academic communities with an accessible digital experience. But beyond our legal obligations, the broader culture of higher education values inclusivity and an exchange of ideas free from artificial barriers.</p>\n<p>While the WordPress accessibility coding standards require new code to meet WCAG 2.0 AA, the new editor has not received a full accessibility audit. Lacking such an audit, the overall accessibility of Gutenberg is unclear. This makes it difficult for colleges and universities to determine the best course of action when deciding how to upgrade to the new editing experience.</p>\n<p>At the conclusion of Tenon&#8217;s testing, WPCampus will publish a public report documenting their findings. Beyond higher education, we hope the audit report will be a valuable resource across the WordPress community. We’re also working with Tenon on some exciting possibilities to help in understanding the audit results, so stay tuned for more announcements!</p>\n<h2>Updated Audit Timeline</h2>\n<p>When we released our <a href=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/2018/10/gutenberg-a11y-audit-rfp/\">request for proposals</a> last October, we included a timeline with a target completion date of January 17, 2019. That timeline has proven to be a little ambitious, which was entirely our fault. All of the amazing vendors who submitted proposals were up to the task of meeting that target date. But our process for evaluating and selecting a vendor ran longer than anticipated, making January 17 impractical.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, here is our updated timeline:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Wednesday, January 9:</strong> Project kickoff</li>\n<li><strong>Thursday, January 31:</strong> Progress update at <a href=\"https://online.dev5290.wpcampus.org/schedule/wpcampus-gutenberg-accessibility-audit/\">WPCampus Online</a></li>\n<li><strong>Late February:</strong> Audit report released</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Selection Committee</h2>\n<p>We received seven spectacular proposals, each with its own testing philosophy and approach.

This audit will help higher education institutions, and the whole WordPress community, make informed decisions about when and how to upgrade to the new editor.</p>\n<p>We received numerous proposals and our selection committee is hard at work, reviewing and evaluating each and every one. We’re not ready to announce our selection, but we’re hoping to finalize the vendor and release an updated timeline for the audit soon.</p>\n<p><strong>We’re going to need your help to make it happen.</strong></p>\n<p>A professional accessibility audit is a large expense for a small nonprofit like WPCampus.</p>\n<p>Accessibility is important to all of us in the WordPress community. We’re asking for your help to fund the audit and ensure this important research is completed.</p>\n<p><strong>Every dollar counts. If you’re willing and able to support this project, please consider donating.</strong></p>\n<p><a class=\"button large expand\" href=\"#donate\">Donate to fund the Gutenberg accessibility audit</a></p>\n<h2>Our initial fundraising goal</h2>\n<p>Here’s the awkward part: we don’t actually know how much money we need yet.</p>\n<p>Each of the proposals we received approaches the audit a little differently, and each one comes with a different price tag. Until our selection committee chooses a vendor, we don’t actually know how much this will cost.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, we’re setting a target fundraising goal somewhere in the middle, between the lowest and highest proposals: <strong>$30,000</strong>.</p>\n<p>When we select a vendor, we’ll announce exactly how much the audit will cost. When you contribute, you’ll have the option of signing up for our newsletter, which will be the best source for updates.</p>\n<p>If the final amount is more than what we raise, we may need to ask for more contributions. If we raise more than we need, we’ll designate the extra money for accessibility efforts like the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Future accessibility audits (either of Gutenberg or of other parts of WordPress)</li>\n<li>Live captioning at our events</li>\n<li>Captioning all our recorded conference sessions and podcasts</li>\n<li>Accessibility professional development opportunities for WPCampus members</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What you get when you donate</h2>\n<p>No fancy swag or Kickstarter-style rewards. But when the accessibility audit is complete, WPCampus will publish the final report, and any supporting documents, on its website. The report will be free and open to the public.</p>\n<p>We’ll also post your name, company, or organization on our website to recognize and thank you for helping make this happen. You may also donate anonymously, if that’s your preference.</p>\n<p><em>FYI: WPCampus is a nonprofit organization, but does not have 501c3 status. Your donation will not be tax deductible.</em></p>\n<p><a class=\"button large expand\" href=\"#donors\">View existing donors</a></p>\n<h2>What happens next</h2>\n<p>We’re hoping to select and announce a vendor soon. Once that happens, we’ll update our fundraising goal and our project timeline. We’re still aiming to release the audit report by January 17, 2019, but that date may shift slightly as we work with the vendor.</p>\n<p>Once the report is complete, we’ll be sharing its findings in as many different ways as we can. We want this to be useful for everyone in the higher ed and WordPress communities, whether you’re a designer, developer, manager, or content creator.</p>\n<p>If that sounds useful to you (and we hope it does), please consider donating!</p>\n<h2 id=\"donate\">Donation form</h2>\n<p><em>The fundraising drive has ended.</em> Visit the <a href=\"/audit/\">main audit page</a> for more information.</p>\n<p><em>This donation form is powered by the <a href=\"https://givewp.com/\">Give WordPress plugin</a>.

Instead, RC1 will now be released on the 19th.  While I would personally like to see this pushed back even further (until next year), this at least gets us past Thanksgiving, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday.</p>\n<p>A second bit of good news came out earlier this week when the core team <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/11/07/classic-editor-plugin-support-window/\">announced</a> they will support the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/\">Classic Editor plugin</a> until December 31, 2021.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Classic Editor plugin will be officially supported until <strong>December 31, 2021</strong>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>While I applaud the core team for committing to long-term support of the Classic Editor plugin, it still doesn&#8217;t address the continued accessibility issues with Gutenberg. If Gutenberg is the future, then we need to make sure it is accessible to <em>everyone</em>. To aid organizations (Higher Education in particular) in the evaluation of adopting Gutenberg, WPCampus is now <a href=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/2018/10/gutenberg-a11y-audit-rfp/\">accepting proposals</a> from accessibility testing vendors to audit the Gutenberg editor. Results from the audit will be published to the WPCampus site.  The deadline for proposal submission is November 14. If you currently work with an accessibility testing vendor, we would greatly appreciate you letting them know of our RFP.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/plugins/"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/security/"},{"id":"7b9f7495-e01f-52fb-8211-386c845eb899","wordpress_id":82,"count":4,"name":"Themes","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/themes/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"eacde366-7114-5a6e-af31-992ad3cbd4a0","wordpress_id":30257,"slug":"vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-for-the-weeks-of-october-20-through-november-2-2018","path":"/blog/2018/11/vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-for-the-weeks-of-october-20-through-november-2-2018/","author":[{"id":"5be72c28-6949-53f8-b212-3feb5a9983de","path":"gilzow","display_name":"Paul Gilzow","email":"gilzowp@missouri.edu","twitter":"gilzow","website":"http://missouri.edu/","company":"University of Missouri","company_position":"Programmer Analyst","bio":"Web application security and accessibility evangelist.

The recent 508 refresh brought these requirements in line with <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/\">WCAG 2.0 level AA</a>, an industry standard that helps ensure accessibility. WCAG 2.0 is also <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/policies/\">commonly used as a baseline for policies</a> governing many WPCampus participants outside the United States, with the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/blog/2018/09/wcag-2-1-adoption-in-europe/\">European Union already moving to WCAG 2.1</a>.</p>\n<p>Beyond our institutions’ legal obligations, colleges and universities worldwide have committed to providing an accessible digital experience to their diverse communities. This is consistent with the broader culture of higher education, which values inclusivity and an exchange of ideas free from artificial barriers.</p>\n<p>While the WordPress accessibility coding standards require new code to meet WCAG 2.0 AA, the new editor has not received a full accessibility audit. Lacking such an audit, the overall accessibility of Gutenberg is unclear. This makes it difficult for colleges and universities to determine the best course of action once WordPress 5.0 is released with Gutenberg as the default editor.</p>\n<h2>Project Goals and Scope</h2>\n<p>WPCampus seeks proposals from accessibility testing vendors to audit the Gutenberg editor. This audit will provide our participating institutions (and the WordPress community at large) an independent assessment that may be used to help determine:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>potential legal risk (if any) posed by upgrading to Gutenberg</li>\n<li>potential challenges when supporting the new editor, particularly for assistive technology users</li>\n<li>potential impact of Gutenberg on the accessibility of public-facing web content</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The final report from the audit (and any appropriate supporting documentation) will be published on the WPCampus website.</p>\n<p>More information about the project scope and deliverables can be found within the RFP.</p>\n<h2>Timeline</h2>\n<p>WordPress 5.0 has a November 19, 2018 scheduled release date. We are looking to have an audit completed and published as soon as possible, so that it can inform decision-making at WPCampus institutions.

The plugin includes code that allows for unauthenticated file uploads and did not include code in the upload process to verify user authorization to perform the upload.  The package does include an .htaccess file to force the download of any uploaded file; however, this assumes the site is using Apache for the web server, and that Apache is set up to follow user-land htaccess files.  Unfortunately, the codebase has over 7000 forks and has been bundled into numerous other packages.  While a fix has been released, it will take some time, if ever, to get the updated code into all the different packages where it has been included. We&#8217;ll most likely see this vulnerability crop up again as researchers and threat agents discover its use in other packages.</p>\n<p>The 5.X branch of PHP will officially reach end-of-life for security updates as of December 31 of this year.  Unfortunately, according to w3techs.com, version 5.X of PHP makes up 78.1% of all php websites, with 78.9% of all sites tracked using PHP. This means that by the end of the year, 60% of all sites online will be running an unsupported version of PHP.  If your institution is still on 5.X begin engaging with your System Administrators to begin plans to upgrade as soon as possible. As an added bonus, <a href=\"https://kinsta.com/blog/php-7-hhvm-benchmarks/\">PHP7.X is significantly faster than PHP5.X</a>. Hopefully this final death knell of PHP5.X will push WordPress core to <em>finally</em> update the minimum PHP version to something more current.</p>\n<h2>Other News</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://2018.highedweb.org/\">HighEdWeb 2018</a> starts this weekend.   I sincerely hope that I&#8217;ll be seeing many of you there.

This means the 4.9.9 release has been shelved unless the core team is unable to release 5.0 before the end of the year:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8230;the intention is to have 5.0 out (including some small fixes to ensure compatibility) before PHP 7.3 is released. If 5.0 delays significantly, then there will be a 4.9.9 release with just the PHP 7.3 compatibility fixes.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In addition, from the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/10/04/dev-chat-summary-october-3rd-5-0-week-1/\">October 3rd Dev Chat</a>, Matt Mullenweg indicated that he plans to continue releasing minor updates that includes new features/updates:</p>\n<blockquote><p>@matt: open to having 5.0.x releases that are like the 4.9.x releases that bring in some larger updates or improvements we push off (e.g., servehappy the WordPress PHP education initiative)</p></blockquote>\n<p>This leaves those of us who are under strict change management policies in a bit of a bind.  It will very challenging to introduce Gutenberg to a large audience in an enterprise setting in six short weeks. You can certainly upgrade to 5.0 and install the classic editor but given Matt&#8217;s statement above, it&#8217;s very possible that additional Gutenberg-related features will be pushed out as minor updates (which fall under the default auto-update setting).  Several have mentioned staying at 4.9.8 if you aren&#8217;t ready to upgrade. However, many of us in Higher Education are required to stay on current supported branches of a product.  <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Supported_Versions\">WordPress&#8217; support policy</a> states:</p>\n<blockquote><p>WordPress will be backported security updates when possible, but there are no guarantee and no timeframe for older releases. There are no fixed period of support nor Long Term Support (LTS) version such as Ubuntu&#8217;s. None of these are safe to use, except the latest series, which is actively maintained.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Which means to be compliant, we <em>have</em> to upgrade to 5.0 or begin working on being granted an exception to the policy. For now, my suggestion would be to upgrade when it is released, install the classic editor plugin and <em>disable</em> auto-updates to prevent new, unverified features from being introduced into your system.  This means <strong>you will need to </strong><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">subscribe</a><strong> to the core announcements</strong> so that you can apply any security-related updates, while simultaneously trying to get everyone in your organization up-to-speed on the new interface as quickly as possible.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/plugins/"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/security/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"61d0856f-9cb4-50af-8d86-f2f042ad0ebc","wordpress_id":29411,"slug":"vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-for-the-week-of-september-28-2018","path":"/blog/2018/09/vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-for-the-week-of-september-28-2018/","author":[{"id":"5be72c28-6949-53f8-b212-3feb5a9983de","path":"gilzow","display_name":"Paul Gilzow","email":"gilzowp@missouri.edu","twitter":"gilzow","website":"http://missouri.edu/","company":"University of Missouri","company_position":"Programmer Analyst","bio":"Web application security and accessibility evangelist.

Instead of the original focus on Accessibility, Internationalization, Servehappy, and Gutenberg preparation, the new version 4.9.9 (if one is released at all) will instead be focused on PHP7.3 compatibility fixes. A new release date has not been announced.</p>\n<h2>Other Security News</h2>\n<p>A critical <span class=\"s1\">Privilege Escalation Vulnerability affecting <a href=\"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2748\">RHEL</a>, CentOS and <a href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-14634\">Debian Jessie</a> systems was <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/new-linux-mutagen-astronomy-security-flaw-impacts-red-hat-and-centos-distros/\">disclosed</a> earlier this week with details and proof-of-concept (PoC) code.  </span><span class=\"s1\">Red Hat has released patches for RHEL/CentOS systems, but patches for Debian Jessie are still being developed. Administrators for RHEL/CentOS should apply the patches immediately;  a</span><span class=\"s1\">dministrators of Debian Jessie systems should monitor for system calls to create_elf_tables() until a patch becomes available in order to detect potential exploitation of this vulnerability.  </span></p>\n<p>An <a href=\"https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/mediawiki-announce/2018-September/000223.html\">update</a> for MediaWiki was released late last week that addresses <a href=\"https://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041695\">multiple security issues</a> which potentially could have allowed a remote authenticated user to bypass security restrictions and potentially obtain sensitive information.  Updates are available for all supported branches.</p>\n<p>Earlier this week, Chegg <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/26/chegg-resets-40-million-user-passwords-after-data-breach/\">announced</a> it had reset the passwords on more than 40 million of its users due to a data breach earlier this year.  The breach affected not only the Chegg&#8217;s website but also its citation service, EasyBib, as well. While many of us may not use Chegg directly, the real issue for us is that many people reuse passwords, and most of us probably have students who utilize Chegg&#8217;s service.</p>\n<p>Along those same lines, <a href=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/09/security-update/\">Facebook announced</a> today that some 50 million users may have been affected by a security vulnerability with the &#8220;View As&#8221; feature. The vulnerability allowed remote attackers to acquire Facebook access tokens which would allow them to take over other users&#8217; accounts.  Faccebook has reset access tokens for 50 million users that were affected, and reset tokens for another 40 million that used the feature in the last year.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/plugins/"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/security/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"54cdfef3-0019-5729-96a4-8b5828beccfb","wordpress_id":29247,"slug":"vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-for-the-week-of-september-21-2018","path":"/blog/2018/09/vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-for-the-week-of-september-21-2018/","author":[{"id":"5be72c28-6949-53f8-b212-3feb5a9983de","path":"gilzow","display_name":"Paul Gilzow","email":"gilzowp@missouri.edu","twitter":"gilzow","website":"http://missouri.edu/","company":"University of Missouri","company_position":"Programmer Analyst","bio":"Web application security and accessibility evangelist.

Be sure to check out their services.</p>\n</div>\n<p>There’s a quiet dread shared by every higher education web manager.</p>\n<p>“If you take our logo away from our header,” they fear, “we’d look like every other university website out there today.”</p>\n<p>Brand differentiation in higher education is difficult. There is a “sea of sameness” when it comes to the way most colleges and universities position themselves: expert faculty, ideal location, experiential learning, a global alumni network. Sound familiar?</p>\n<p>This “sea of sameness” often bleeds into the brand’s creative expression. Many homepages could be easily replaced by any other institution’s homepage. Look familiar?</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-27189\" src=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/wp-content/uploads/universal_homepage.png\" alt=\"A list of common homepage sections\" width=\"324\" height=\"476\" /></p>\n<p>Breaking away from the “sea of sameness” is no simple task. Once you’ve moved beyond the identical examples of shiny sites sent over by your leadership team, it’s time to differentiate. Gen Z is notoriously demanding, and your website must be precision-engineered and unique. After all, it has to stand out among your competitors — and the nearly 5,000 colleges and universities in the U.S. alone.</p>\n<p><strong>Here are three ideas to help you break free.</strong></p>\n<h2>1. Move to modular design</h2>\n<p>We believe modular design will improve and help maintain higher ed websites for the long haul. In the past, institutions focused efforts on developing web pages that serve specific content needs and short-term goals. Template-based design is difficult to improve and maintain. Worse, it has contributed over time to the “sea of sameness.” These pages are typically designed with integrated functionality and complex visual design.</p>\n<p>At mStoner, we make a conscious effort to think, design, and code with greater flexibility in mind. We make functional and aesthetic web components that can recombine into a number of goal-driven experiences.</p>\n<p>The beauty of this style of modular design? Your team can easily upgrade a component that is underperforming without sacrificing the integrity of the page or the site as a whole.</p>\n<p>Modular design systems will also empower designers and content editors. Teams will make smarter decisions that don’t require huge effort. If you need to augment a page with new functionality, you can assemble existing components. And you can create new experiences without the limits of a template designed for a different purpose.</p>\n<p>By taking a modular approach at the onset of a redesign, we’re able to build a product that is flexible, adaptable, and improvable based on new institutional goals or changing user needs.</p>\n<p><em>Adapted from </em><a href=\"https://www.mstoner.com/blog/design-and-usability/three-higher-ed-design-trends-2018/\"><em>Three Higher Ed Design Trends for 2018</em></a></p>\n<h2>2. Search for answers beyond higher ed</h2>\n<p>Students, prospects and alumni don’t spend all day browsing higher ed websites. Like most people, they spend much of their time on consumer sites from Netflix to Amazon to Facebook. Their point of comparison when they first visit your site isn’t your competitors: it’s the web’s most popular sites.</p>\n<p>Get outside the “sea of sameness” by considering how your audience interacts with their favorite sites and building to those expectations. How easily can applicants start — or finish — an application? Where have you placed your search bar and how do searchers filter results? How does your design encourage prospects to get in touch?</p>\n<p>If your design isn’t built considering the implicit standards of the popular web, you’re just building another higher ed website for other higher ed designers, not for your actual audience.</p>\n<p>Need a life preserver to get out of the “sea of sameness”? Consider hiring a UX designer or consultant. These professionals bring a deep understanding of the industry. They will ask new questions and surface new insights that will help you differentiate your site. They’ll also build personas that can help you prioritize your investments.</p>\n<p>One key differentiator beloved by consumers but too rarely considered? Site search. A key platform for user satisfaction and market research, search is relied upon by some 68% of website visitors. Too often, poor site search results in quick departure from a site. Effective search — with filters, synonyms, machine learning, and more than ten blue links — makes a tremendous difference for consumers. And insights gleaned from good search analytics can help higher ed leaders understand the specific interests of visitors in their own words.</p>\n<h2>3. Find insights in your website data and experiment</h2>\n<p>Good data doesn’t necessarily mean good insight. Over seventeen years building websites for higher ed, we’ve found at mStoner that well-intentioned people with good data can still make really bad decisions.</p>\n<p>Learning to draw true insights from the right data is part of the shift from of the “sea of sameness.” It’s no longer enough to scan a high-level audience report from Google Analytics once a month. Find the <em>why</em> behind your data before you build a case. Your analytics will only help to identify existing issues: it’s your job to diagnose the cause and to generate potential solutions.</p>\n<p>For example, web managers often debate how far visitors scroll down key pages, and whether visitors need cues to help them see important content. Gaining insight on visitor scrolling behavior requires tracking scroll depth on key pages and reviewing the data to determine how visitors scroll. Equipped with this knowledge, you can make important content placement decisions that work for <em>your</em> audience instead of relying on what your peers are doing.</p>\n<p>How do you know what site improvements will move you closer to hitting or exceeding your goals? Test and experiment!</p>\n<p>You might create and test a couple of variants of key page elements, such as the color and the copy that you use for a call to action on a specific page. Deploy an A/B test to discover what combination of words and colors works together best. Based on the results of this experiment, cascade changes across the rest of your site.</p>\n<p><em>Adapted from </em><a href=\"https://www.mstoner.com/blog/strategy/four-strategies-move-edu-project-process/\"><em>Four Strategies to Move Your .edu from Project to Process</em></a></p>\n<p>Whether you’re starting to look at a new site or are just refining your existing property, swim against the current in the sea of sameness. Provide your project with a solid foundation by carefully scrutinizing your audience, technology, and brand. For an easy win, focus on the small challenges you can tackle now. Then improve incrementally over time by carefully following the (right) data. And never lose sight of who you are designing for. You’ll be swimming in new waters in no time.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9822bd00-f7fb-5566-ac1e-e000cd9b2dee","wordpress_id":169,"count":13,"name":"Sponsors","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/sponsors/"},{"id":"a3025401-433e-5124-82fd-e9ac38d13ee3","wordpress_id":170,"count":7,"name":"WPCampus 2018","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/wpcampus-2018/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"a19e0c49-21d3-5c16-be84-5c7d13ac3d65","wordpress_id":26713,"slug":"vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-for-the-weeks-of-june-22-through-july-8-2018","path":"/blog/2018/07/vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-for-the-weeks-of-june-22-through-july-8-2018/","author":[{"id":"5be72c28-6949-53f8-b212-3feb5a9983de","path":"gilzow","display_name":"Paul Gilzow","email":"gilzowp@missouri.edu","twitter":"gilzow","website":"http://missouri.edu/","company":"University of Missouri","company_position":"Programmer Analyst","bio":"Web application security and accessibility evangelist.

We’re particularly excited about being on the campus of WashU (where we enjoy hosting their <a href=\"https://sites.wustl.edu/\">sites.wustl.edu</a> WordPress network).</p>\n<p>As for CampusPress, you may not know that we have been quietly hosting WordPress for schools and universities longer than anyone else. In fact, our large Edublogs network with over 4 million sites launched before WordPress.com!</p>\n<p>We also pioneered the ‘managed host’ model long before any of the other countless WordPress hosts existed. Our 13+ years of experience and expertise in Multisite at scale arguably can’t be matched.</p>\n<p>But, to be fair, there have been some valid downsides to our hosting model over the years, particularly as WordPress has changed and needs have grown with many of our higher ed customers. In short, we have developed a reputation for being less flexible with developer access than some would like. To some extent, this has been by design historically, to guarantee the reliability and security of sites we host.</p>\n<p>To that end, we’ve been listening and investing heavily, and that’s why at WPCampus we’d love to chat about our <a href=\"https://campuspress.com/blog/new-dedicated-and-private-clusters-now-available/\">new dedicated cluster environments</a> and other measures that we now have in place to be more developer friendly, while keeping to our same high standards as before.</p>\n<p>With our improved flexibility, we continue to be the solution for self-service WordPress Multisite platforms for faculty, staff, and student sites and blogs. We also see more and more networks being launched to serve ePortfolios and direct classroom use (with our Canvas and LTI integrations).</p>\n<p>And more recently, we have a growing number of main and other mission-critical university websites under our guidance, which we’re incredibly excited about.</p>\n<p>In short, if it can be done with WordPress, we can support it, host it, and at any scale.</p>\n<p>We hope to see you in St. Louis!</p>\n<p><a class=\"wpc-button wpc-button--expand\" href=\"https://campuspress.com/\">Learn more about CampusPress</a></p>\n<div class=\"wpc-callout wpc-callout--primary\"><a href=\"https://2018.dev5290.wpcampus.org/\">WPCampus 2018</a> will take place July 12-14, 2018 on the campus of Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri.

Those values foster a unique kinship with our partners and clients in academia, which promote similar ideals, through education, research, and open collaboration. It’s no wonder that so many of 10up’s leaders have worked in higher education, including our Chief Executive Officer, John Eckman—a former professor <a href=\"https://2018.dev5290.wpcampus.org/schedule/what-do-other-cms-offer-higher-education/\">who is speaking at this year’s WPCampus</a>.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re gratified to include several academic institutions in our portfolio, from an early HighEdWeb award-winning project for Bates College, to projects of all shapes and sizes for renowned universities like Northeastern, Stanford, UC Davis, and Harvard, to name just a few.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-25556 aligncenter\" src=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/wp-content/uploads/10up-image2-800x457.png\" alt=\"A screenshot of eCorner.

Many universities maintain multiple WordPress sites, often using network (multisite) mode to segregate departments, in addition to one off installations for microsites. Distributor can keep a single piece of content—like an event or course description or professor’s biography—synchronized across multiple sites and departments. During our beta period, we’ve accepted dozens of applicants applying and extending it to higher education.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-25555 aligncenter\" src=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/wp-content/uploads/10up-image1-800x486.png\" alt=\"A screenshot of the WordPress admin for a project for World Park Explorer.\" width=\"800\" height=\"486\" srcset=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/wp-content/uploads/10up-image1-800x486.png 800w, https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/wp-content/uploads/10up-image1-768x467.png 768w, https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/wp-content/uploads/10up-image1-600x365.png 600w, https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/wp-content/uploads/10up-image1.png 928w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>Come find us at WPCampus and discuss the intersection of open source and Higher Education.</p>\n<div class=\"wpc-callout wpc-callout--primary\">\n<p><a href=\"https://2018.dev5290.wpcampus.org/\">WPCampus 2018</a> will take place July 12-14, 2018 on the campus of Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri.

The updated report from Talos includes additional routers that are being targeted by the malware, that the malware includes the ability to inject malicious code into the web traffic as it passes through the device, and the ability to brick the device. While rebooting the device helps disrupt the malware, it does not remove it, and there is no easy way to tell if a router has been infected. It&#8217;s important to note though that just because your router might be on Talos&#8217; list that doesn&#8217;t mean your router is infected.  It just means your router is capable of running the malware once infected.  The actual infection has to happen through some other vulnerability, many of which have already been patched by the manufacturer. The problem lies in that most people <em>don&#8217;t</em> patch their home routers, and that detecting an infected router is difficult.  If you have been religiously updating your router, then you are probably safe.  For everyone else, or if you&#8217;re just paranoid, the only safe, reliable way to ensure you&#8217;re not affected is to factory reset the router and then apply all patches/upgrades.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/plugins/"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/security/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"7432f105-f02e-5632-9032-1ab6891a0a6b","wordpress_id":25231,"slug":"about-sitelock-wpcampus-2018-sponsor","path":"/blog/2018/06/about-sitelock-wpcampus-2018-sponsor/","author":[{"id":"30b06cc5-836e-5786-94b9-1e96552b71d9","path":"adamwwarner","display_name":"Adam Warner","email":"awarner@sitelock.com","twitter":"wpmodder","website":"https://www.sitelock.com/","company":"SiteLock","company_position":"Open Source Community Manager","bio":""}],"title":"Meet SiteLock, WPCampus 2018 Sponsor","type":"post","status":"publish","date":"2018-06-06T14:42:37.000Z","dateFormatted":"June 6, 2018","excerpt":"<p>This post is part of a series featuring sponsors from our WPCampus 2018 conference.

Be sure to check out their services and say hi to them in St. Louis.</p>\n</div>\n<p>The internet was born on university campuses. It started with an &#8220;Interface Message Processor&#8221; (essentially a router) built and housed on the campus of UCLA. It was the first node of a new network.</p>\n<p>On October 29th, 1969 the first message was sent to another node built at the Stanford Research Institute. The first message consisted of just two letters, &#8220;LO&#8221;, the beginning of the word &#8220;LOGIN&#8221;, because the system crashed. An hour later they tried again and it worked. If you haven’t <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/this-is-the-room-where-the-internet-was-born-1527205592\">read the origin story of the internet</a>, it’s a fascinating read.</p>\n<p>Without the technical and academic innovation that happens behind the walls of higher education institutions, the world would be a very different place. And without events like WPCampus focusing on WordPress as it pertains to use within Higher Education, SiteLock wouldn’t have the opportunity to share our passion for technology and education.</p>\n<h2>Supporting Current and Future Generations of Technologists</h2>\n<p>At SiteLock, we’re extremely passionate about giving back to the communities where we live and work. We are especially dedicated to supporting STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) programs for schools in need.</p>\n<p>In 2015, SiteLock established the <a href=\"https://wpdistrict.sitelock.com/blog/sitelock-digital-kids-fund-2017-recap/\">Digital Kids Fund</a> to help support technology-based projects at local schools in Arizona and in 2016, we partnered with DonorsChoose.org, an organization that makes it easy for anyone to help a classroom in need, to fund STEM-related projects in schools located in the Phoenix, Arizona and Jacksonville, Florida areas.  We donated a total of $50k, which supported 198 projects and benefitted 19,992 students at 141 schools.</p>\n<p>In 2017, we continued our partnership with <a href=\"https://www.donorschoose.org/\">DonorsChoose.org</a>, but increased our total donation to $60k and included an employee gift card program! Every SiteLock employee was given a $25 gift card to support a STEM-related project in the Phoenix and Jacksonville areas. In total, our donations have supported 234 projects benefiting 30,952 students at 184 schools!</p>\n<h2>Who We Are</h2>\n<p>If you’re not already familiar with SiteLock, we are a global website security company protecting over 12 million websites worldwide, with over 4 million of those sites powered by WordPress. SiteLock delivers a 360-degree website security solution to find, fix and prevent malware and other threats from affecting websites and their visitors.</p>\n<p>Founded in 2008, the SiteLock cloud-based suite of products includes automatic file and database malware scanning and removal, automated security patching, an advanced web application firewall, static application security testing, PCI compliance and website acceleration powered by a global CDN.</p>\n<h2>Supporting the Community at Large</h2>\n<p>In 2016, we launched our popular “Secure Your Word” campaign to help promote WordPress security. Today, “Secure Your Word” branded shirts are a fixture at WordPress events worldwide. SiteLock has been a global community sponsor and remains committed to sponsoring individual WordCamps and other WordPress-focused events in 2018. It’s all part of our goal of <a href=\"https://wpdistrict.sitelock.com/blog/fostering-the-wordpress-community-we-want/\">Fostering the WordPress Community</a> as a whole.</p>\n<p>Not only is the company passionate about the WordPress mission of “Democratizing Publishing,” but you’ll also find members of the SiteLock team sharing their own WordPress experience through speaking opportunities. In fact, our own Jamie Schmid will be leading the <a href=\"https://2018.dev5290.wpcampus.org/schedule/content-strategy-workshop/\">Building a solid foundation: Introduction to content strategy</a> workshop and we’re an official sponsor of WPCampus.</p>\n<p>But it’s not just about sharing knowledge with others, it’s also about listening to the needs of users and businesses within the community, and leveraging these experiences and resources to create solutions that address specific needs. That’s why <a href=\"https://blog.sitelock.com/2017/12/smart-plus/\">SiteLock announced its new SMART®PLUS&#x2122; product</a> during WordCamp U.S. in December of 2017.</p>\n<h2>Website Security Innovation with SMART®PLUS&#x2122;</h2>\n<p>Similar to how the SiteLock SMART&#x2122; and INFINITY&#x2122; scans automatically find and remove malware in a website file structure, <a href=\"https://blog.sitelock.com/2017/12/smart-plus/\">SMART PLUS</a> extends the company’s automatic malware identification and removal abilities to include automated vulnerability patching for the core files of popular content management systems (CMS), as well as automated WordPress database scanning and cleaning.</p>\n<p>SMART PLUS also provides the ability to identify and automatically remove spam comments, and can be customized in order to filter specific keywords and phrases that matter to you. This saves valuable time from the generally tedious task of reviewing and maintaining the cleanliness and quality of the comments included within your content.</p>\n<h2>We Can’t Wait to Meet You in Person!</h2>\n<p>We’re excited to be a Graduate level sponsor for WPCampus 2018 and welcome you to stop by our table, say hello and learn more about how we protect websites. Oh yeah, and don’t forget to get your own &#8220;Secure Your Word&#8221; t-shirt!</p>\n<div class=\"wpc-callout wpc-callout--primary\">\n<p><a href=\"https://2018.dev5290.wpcampus.org/\">WPCampus 2018</a> will take place July 12-14, 2018 on the campus of Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri.

However, from what I understand, the core team will eventually enable this release for autoupdates, so if you are worried about it breaking your site, you&#8217;ll need to begin testing sooner rather than later.</p>\n<h2>Other Security News</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/05/service-leaked-locations-of-us-cell-phones-for-free-no-password-required/\">Website leaked real-time location of most US cell phones to almost anyone</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hardcoded-password-found-in-cisco-enterprise-software-again/\">Hardcoded Password Found in Cisco Enterprise Software, Again</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/@evstykas/remote-smart-car-hacking-with-just-a-phone-2fe7ca682162\">Remote smart car hacking with just a phone</a></li>\n</ul>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/plugins/"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/security/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"db3fa35c-bc99-5d8b-af49-aabf96913cbe","wordpress_id":24191,"slug":"vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-for-the-week-of-may-11-2018","path":"/blog/2018/05/vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-for-the-week-of-may-11-2018/","author":[{"id":"5be72c28-6949-53f8-b212-3feb5a9983de","path":"gilzow","display_name":"Paul Gilzow","email":"gilzowp@missouri.edu","twitter":"gilzow","website":"http://missouri.edu/","company":"University of Missouri","company_position":"Programmer Analyst","bio":"Web application security and accessibility evangelist.

Our team in NC State&#8217;s central IT unit was kind-of listening to the Gutenberg chatter, and we had tested it enough to know we didn&#8217;t want to think about it. I had pushed it out of my mind as a &#8220;this is going to happen some day in the <em>distant future</em>&#8221; kind of a thing.</p>\n<p>Then came WordCamp US in December. Morten Rand-Hendriksen&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2017/12/10/morten-rand-hendriksen-gutenberg-and-the-wordpress-of-tomorrow/\">&#8220;WordPress of Tomorrow&#8221; session</a> and Matías Ventura&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2017/12/04/matt-mullenweg-state-of-the-word-2017/\">State of the Word live-demo</a> made Gutenberg feel a lot more imminent. And then Matt Mullenweg dropped the big bombshell: Gutenberg would be ready by <strong>April 2018</strong>.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s still not clear whether &#8220;ready&#8221; is synonymous with &#8220;released&#8221; (and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/4vS_jR5-nIo?t=12m13s\">Matt Mullenweg has avoided a firm timeline</a>). There&#8217;s definitely still some important work to be done, especially for things like <a href=\"http://rianrietveld.com/2018/03/05/keyboard-test-gutenberg-first-try/\">keyboard navigability</a>. But the Gutenberg team has done incredible work over the last year-plus building and improving a new editor. Whether it&#8217;s April or not, Gutenberg is definitely coming soon to a campus near you.</p>\n<p>So how do you prepare your university for the Gutenpocalypse?</p>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Like many higher ed institutions, our campus had only a vague notion of this &#8220;Gutenberg&#8221; thing. That meant it was our job to get the word out.</p>\n<p>NC State University, like many other big land-grant schools, is a big fan of decentralization. There&#8217;s no campus-wide web governance, nor is there even a mandate to use a common CMS. Every college and college-level unit is responsible its own web presence. In some cases, that responsibility gets delegated further, with individual departments hiring developers, partnering with other campus web teams, or contracting with outside vendors.</p>\n<p>All of that is to say, there&#8217;s no &#8220;NC State web team&#8221; that holds regular meetings. There&#8217;s no list of every person who writes code or creates content. Our campus has sluggishly wandered in the general direction of WordPress over the past few years, so we know these people are out there. But our team in central IT is concerned with communication, training, and support for everyone—even the WordPress sites that we&#8217;ve never touched and know very little about.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re at a smaller or more centralized institution, this is one aspect of Gutenberg planning (and really, change management in general) that&#8217;s a little easier. For us, just communicating our message to campus is a challenge.</p>\n<h2>Three Audiences</h2>\n<p>Changes to WordPress will mean different things to different people. We quickly settled on three main audiences:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Content Creators</strong> – People with day-to-day content-editing responsibilities.</li>\n<li><strong>Site Administrators</strong> – People who perform admin functions in WordPress, like user management.</li>\n<li><strong>Developers</strong> – People who are comfortable writing code.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There&#8217;s lots of overlap in these three groups. A lot of us are developer-admins, doing some of both. But there are also site administrators who have never touched PHP or CSS, relying on other campus web teams or outside vendors for their web support.</p>\n<p>For <strong>content creators</strong>, upgrading to Gutenberg means getting to know a new editor. We&#8217;re holding a <a href=\"https://design.oit.ncsu.edu/docs/gutenberg/training/#content-creators\">series of workshops for these users</a> based on <a href=\"https://design.oit.ncsu.edu/2018/02/02/gutenberg-testing/\">user testing we conducted in January</a>. We&#8217;ve also built a demo site using <a href=\"https://frontenberg.tomjn.com/\">Tom J. Nowell&#8217;s Frontenberg</a> to give curious content creators a quick-and-easy way to get to know the new editor.</p>\n<p>For <strong>site administrators</strong>, upgrading to Gutenberg means getting to know a new editor <em>and</em> supporting users with questions about the new editor. For some campus websites, it also means knowing whether and when to upgrade to Gutenberg or to use the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/\">Classic Editor plugin</a>.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s potentially a very complicated question, especially for a site admin whose site was built by an off-campus vendor. Site administrators need to work through potential theme and plugin conflicts while also preparing for the inevitable support ticket surge. Our <a href=\"https://design.oit.ncsu.edu/docs/gutenberg/training/#site-admins\">site admin workshop</a> tries to help them recognize potential trouble spots and arm them with information and talking points, for when they talk to their content creators and their theme and plugin developers.</p>\n<p>For <strong>developers</strong>, upgrading to Gutenberg means learning all of the same things content creators and site administrators need to know, plus a lot more. Developers also need to know:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What changes need to be made to their themes</li>\n<li>Gutenberg block templates</li>\n<li>How to build a custom Gutenberg block</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That last bullet point sounds a lot easier than it is. Since Gutenblocks are built with JavaScript, the toolbox a lot of us have depended on for years—basic PHP skills plus knowledge of WordPress&#8217;s native API functions—won&#8217;t get us very far.</p>\n<h2>Planning a &#8220;Retreat&#8221;</h2>\n<p>We decided on an all-day &#8220;WordPress developers retreat&#8221; as the best way to share that larger body of knowledge with the campus web developer community, and scheduled it for Friday, March 2. (&#8220;Retreat&#8221; may be an overstatement, because we were still on campus. But we were in a large conference room away from everyone&#8217;s offices, so it felt special!)</p>\n<p>Holding a big in-person event helped to underscore how important these changes are—if we&#8217;re going to the trouble of getting all the WordPress developers together, then you better believe Gutenberg is a big deal. We also knew that bringing everyone together would generate a lot of smart, useful questions.</p>\n<p>In January, we started spamming campus listservs and Slack channels. We also promised baked goods as an added incentive to attend (and as an excuse for me to bake my favorite oatmeal chocolate chip cookie recipe).</p>\n<p>When GutenDay arrived, almost all of the campus WordPress teams we know about represented—plus colleagues from four other North Carolina colleges and universities. We ended up with 34 eager GutenDevs in attendance, which is a phenomenal turnout for our campus.</p>\n<h2>GutenDay</h2>\n<p>Our agenda for GutenDay included thematically-separate morning and afternoon sessions, plus three breakout sessions for smaller-group conversations:</p>\n<p><strong>Morning</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>What, Why &amp; When of Gutenberg</strong> – A brief overview of the last decade of WordPress</li>\n<li><strong>Meet the New Editor</strong> – Guided tour of Gutenberg</li>\n<li><strong>How Will My Users React?</strong> – What we&#8217;ve learned from campus user testing</li>\n<li><strong>What Happens When I Upgrade?</strong> – Four common scenarios for what happens to existing content</li>\n<li><strong>Options for Upgrading</strong> – Information about how and when to upgrade</li>\n<li><strong>Basics of Extending Gutenberg</strong> – Theme-focused Gutenberg code changes</li>\n<li><strong>Block Templates</strong> – Example of a simple block template to showcase its potential</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Afternoon</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Anatomy of a Block</strong> – Walkthrough of block files and functions, and what they do</li>\n<li><strong>Our Plan: NC State Blocks</strong> – Building a campus-branded collection of blocks</li>\n<li><strong>Breakout Sessions</strong>\n<ol>\n<li><em>Build Your Own Custom Gutenblock</em> – Hands-on experience building a custom block</li>\n<li><em>Designing With and For Gutenberg</em> – Hands-on opportunity to update theme code</li>\n<li><em>Gutenplanning</em> – Discussion of training, communications, and other transition resources</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://go.ncsu.edu/GutenDay\">view our presentation slides for the day</a>.</p>\n<p>We structured GutenDay to have lots of on-ramps into the Gutenworld rather than jumping straight into block development. There&#8217;s plenty of CSS and PHP to prepare themes for Gutenberg, and everyone was able to leave GutenDay with something actionable even if they weren&#8217;t quite ready for JavaScript development.</p>\n<h3>About the JavaScript thing…</h3>\n<p>At the beginning of the day, I asked the attendees if anyone would say they were extremely confident in their JavaScript skills. We had one person raise her hand—and even that was a pretty tentative hand.</p>\n<p>I think that was an important question to start with. Gutenberg&#8217;s JavaScript-ness is a significant change to WordPress, albeit one that&#8217;s been coming for a long time. A lot of us got into the WordPress development world by learning a little PHP at a time, and we&#8217;re going to have to put in some work to make the transition. And since only one hand went up, it&#8217;s helpful to see that&#8217;s a jump we&#8217;ll all be making together.</p>\n<p>The size of that jump was unexpectedly illustrated when our <em>Build Your Own Custom Gutenblock</em> breakout session didn&#8217;t quite go as planned.</p>\n<p>In that breakout session, my colleague Miles Elliott planned to walk attendees through the process of building their first custom block. An easy way to start a new block is with <a href=\"https://github.com/ahmadawais/create-guten-block\">Ahmad Awais&#8217; <strong>create-guten-block</strong> developer toolkit</a>, and Miles planned on using that as a teaching tool. (If you haven&#8217;t tried it before, I highly recommend it.)</p>\n<p>But create-guten-block requires Node.js and npm. While we did ask attendees to set up a WordPress dev environment on their laptops before GutenDay, it never occurred to us to warn that Node would be needed. And for our mostly Mac team, helping folks set those up on their Windows machines wasn&#8217;t something we had prepared for.</p>\n<p>You can get pretty far in the WordPress world without ever needing or thinking about Node.js or npm—and you can build Gutenblocks without them, too! But Gutenberg marks both an opportunity and a challenge for WordPress developers to modernize and upgrade. One lesson we learned from GutenDay is to give that transition the attention it needs.</p>\n[foogallery id=&#8221;19496&#8243;]\n<h2>NC State Blocks</h2>\n<p>In addition to introducing Gutenberg to campus developers, we used GutenDay to kick off development of an NC State Blocks plugin.</p><figure style=\"width: 256px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-medium\" src=\"https://design.oit.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2018/03/wolfenberg.png\" alt=\"Plugin icon of a wolf styled to be reminiscent of a portrait of Johannes Gutenberg.\" width=\"256\" height=\"256\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Johannes Wolfenberg, mascot of the NC State Blocks plugin.</figcaption></figure><p>With so many different ways of extending the Classic Editor, different campus development teams settled into different ways of &#8220;doing WordPress.&#8221; We&#8217;ve reinvented the wheel many times over.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg gives our campus an opportunity to have a WordPress reset, and to standardize and collaborate. The NC State Blocks plugin will contain a core set of campus-branded page element blocks (eg. infoboxes, calls to action, etc.) plus blocks that communicate with other systems (eg. the library&#8217;s publications database).</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s still lots of room for <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/handbook/extensibility/#modifying-blocks-experimental\">customization using block filters</a>, and there will certainly be lots of single-use block plugins built for special situations. But the NC State Blocks plugin will be a shared block starter set, and a big project that all the campus WordPress teams will be working on together.</p>\n<h2>Looking Forward</h2>\n<p>With GutenDay behind us, we&#8217;ve recently begun sorting clients into:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sites we can have ready Spring 2018</li>\n<li>Sites that will need extra time with the Classic Editor plugin, but can go Gutenberg by Fall 2018</li>\n<li>Sites requiring more time</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some of those websites are going to be a lot of work. We have an internal-use &#8220;Gutenberg Pain Index&#8221; to help us prioritize, which considers complexity of a site, number of users, and some client-specific intangibles. But the more we can frontload, the easier the rest of 2018 will be for us.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, our team is now focused on training, building the NC State Blocks plugin, and preparing the websites we manage for the new GutenFuture. Moving a campus to Gutenberg is a massive project—a project that wasn&#8217;t really on our radar as recently as November 2017. But a little communication and collaboration will go a long way. We&#8217;re all in this together.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"7f178d07-3720-57d0-b95b-ebf725c79a98","wordpress_id":62,"count":6,"name":"Core","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/core/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"c7955b14-baf8-527f-9e41-e86abf2edf48","wordpress_id":19274,"slug":"vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-week-march-9-2018","path":"/blog/2018/03/vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-week-march-9-2018/","author":[{"id":"5be72c28-6949-53f8-b212-3feb5a9983de","path":"gilzow","display_name":"Paul Gilzow","email":"gilzowp@missouri.edu","twitter":"gilzow","website":"http://missouri.edu/","company":"University of Missouri","company_position":"Programmer Analyst","bio":"Web application security and accessibility evangelist.

If you have auto-updates enabled, you might have been surprised to see <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/02/wordpress-4-9-4-maintenance-release/\">another WordPress update (4.9.4)</a> come through Tuesday morning around 10am (CST). It seems there was a severe bug in 4.9.3 that caused the auto update feature to break in some sites and will require manual intervention to upgrade to 4.9.4. If you have auto-updates enabled and you did <em><strong>not</strong></em> see a notification of the update Tuesday morning, you will need to manually update to WordPress 4.9.4. Doing so will correct the issue and allow the auto-update feature to work for the next release.</p>\n<p>Separately, a denial-of-service vulnerability was <a href=\"https://baraktawily.blogspot.fr/2018/02/how-to-dos-29-of-world-wide-websites.html\">disclosed yesterday</a> that takes advantage of a default feature in WordPress to overwhelm the server targeting the load-scripts.php and load-styles.php files. Those two files will load up all requested scripts/styles and dynamically concatenate them into one file. The vulnerability comes into play when a request is given to them to load every possible script/style. There are 181 scripts included in core. Instructing the script to read and concatenate that many files into one file, for most hosts, will overwhelm the resources and cause the server to return 500 errors. According to the researcher, the WordPress security team didn’t consider it a core vulnerability and believe it should be handled at the server/host layer. The probability of someone legitimately enqueueing that many scripts/styles is probably fairly low, certainly lower than the probability of someone abusing this feature to cause issues. It should be entirely possible for core to limit the number of files being concatenated to X amount, with the ability to increase the number if problems are encountered.</p>\n<p>In response, the researcher has <a href=\"https://github.com/quitten/wordpress\">forked WordPress</a> with his fixes and has also provided a <a href=\"https://github.com/Quitten/WordPress/blob/master/wp-dos-patch.sh\">patch</a>, but I would <strong>not</strong> suggest using a forked version of WordPress. While the patch is straight-forward, it will require being reapplied after every update (so twice this week). Instead, I would suggest adding a couple of lines to your htaccess file to watch for requests to these file, and block them if the length of the load list is too long.</p>\n<pre>RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/wp-admin/load-(scripts|styles)\\.php$\r\nRewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} load(?:\\[\\])?=(.{256,})$\r\nRewriteRule ^(.*)$ - [F,L]\r\n</pre>\n<p>In the full list of scripts, there are 2650 characters. In the above htaccess example, I’ve set it so if there are more than 256 characters forbid the request. You may need to adjust that number upwards if you find your loaded scripts list is longer.</p>\n<p>If anyone is experienced in nginx conf files and can translate the above to nginx equivalent, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gilzow\">reach out to me</a>, and I&#8217;ll post it here.</p>\n<p>UPDATE: small update to the regex.

It is a security and maintenance release and addresses a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability and 21 other bugs.  If you do not have auto-updates enabled, definitely get the update into your Change Management schedule as soon as possible.</p>\n<h2>Other Security News</h2>\n<p>Totally unrelated to higher education, but still concerning.  It was <a href=\"http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2018/Jan/63\">disclosed</a> earlier this week that there are multiple vulnerabilities in all ASUS brand routers: predictable session tokens, bypassing IP verification, passwords stored in plain text and logged-in information disclosure. While not necessarily popular as a commercial router, Asus routers are fairly popular among consumers.  Asus has released a firmware for several of the issues, with additional fixes coming in February.  If you own an ASUS router, have it check for a firmware update and then apply it as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>The other one I want to mention, given the use of <a href=\"https://shibboleth.net/\">Shibboleth</a> in Higher Ed, is the <a href=\"https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/en/advisories/rt-sa-2017-013/-truncation-of-saml-attributes-in-shibboleth-2\">disclosure</a> of a possible authorization bypass in Shibboleth last weekend by RedTeam Pentesting. This is connected to the Shibboleth <a href=\"https://shibboleth.net/community/advisories/secadv_20180112.txt\">security advisory</a> that went out on January 12.</p>\n<h2>WPCampus Online</h2>\n<p>Last, I want to make sure everyone is aware that <a href=\"https://online.dev5290.wpcampus.org/\">WPCampus Online</a> is in less than two weeks! We have a fantastic <a href=\"https://online.dev5290.wpcampus.org/schedule/\">schedule</a> lined up this year.

Unfortunately, vulnerabilities and disclosures did not rest. Two critical situations were disclosed during that time: an <a href=\"https://blog.nintechnet.com/arbitrary-file-upload-vulnerability-in-wordpress-learndash-lms-plugin/\">Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload</a> discovered in the <a href=\"https://www.learndash.com/\">LearnDash LMS</a> plugin by <a href=\"https://nintechnet.com/\">NinTechNet</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2017/12/plugin-backdoor-supply-chain/\">disclosure by WordFence</a> that three plugins (<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/duplicate-page-and-post/\">Duplicate Page and Post</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/nofollow-all-external-links/\">No Follow All External Links</a>, and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-noexternallinks/\">WP No External Links</a>) contained backdoor code in current versions in the WordPress plugin repository, and appear to be aimed at injecting SEO spam into sites&#8217; output.  The WordPress plugin team have closed all three to new installs from the repository, and released a cleaned version of WP No External Links.  If you are using any of these plugins, you should remove them immediately, and begin looking for a replacement.</p>\n<p>As I <a href=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/2017/12/vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-week-december-22-2017/\">mentioned in my last post</a>, I firmly believe this situation will become ever more prevalent. As a site owner, once you have vetted a plugin and installed it on your site, you trust that future updates will also be safe. It is unfeasible to believe that the majority of site owners will re-evaluate a plugin&#8217;s code after every update.  I know at the University of Missouri, we struggle to get apps re-evaluated every 6 months, let alone every time there&#8217;s a new update to a dependency (plugin) in a site.  While I know that the openness of the WordPress plugin/theme repository has definitely assisted in propelling WordPress to its current market share, with that power, comes responsibility.  As a community, we need to begin to balance the openness of the repository with the responsibility of protecting its users.</p>\n<h2>Other Security News</h2>\n<p>The GIGANTIC news this week was the <a href=\"https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.co.za/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html\">disclosure</a> on January 3rd by the Project Zero team at Google of vulnerabilities in processors (<a href=\"https://spectreattack.com/\">dubbed <em>Meltdown</em> and <em>Spectre</em></a>) from Intel, AMD, and ARM dating all the way back to 1995. Essentially, every device that contains a CPU from the last two decades is susceptible. In addition, it is theoretically possible for these attacks to occur through a website. Operating Systems can, and will be introducing patches over the coming days to mitigate the risk. As you are notified of these patches, please update immediately.  <a href=\"https://www.theregister.co.uk\">The Register</a> was the first news outlet to break the story and has an excellent <a href=\"https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/01/02/intel_cpu_design_flaw/\">write-up</a> covering these vulnerabilities in more detail.</p>\n<p>As site owners, we need to make sure that our hosting partners have updated the underlying operating systems our sites run on.  Many of the major hosting providers have already patched, or announced upcoming patches to protect against these vulnerabilities. If you have not heard from your hosting provider, you should definitely contact them and ask when they plan to apply updates.</p>\n<p>Since it is possible for these attacks to occur online, what can you do to protect yourself until your OS is patched?  Both Google Chrome and <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2018/01/03/mitigations-landing-new-class-timing-attack/\">Firefox</a> are vulnerable currently, with <a href=\"https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/7622138\">Google planning to release a fix in version 64 of Chrome, due out January 23rd</a>. In the meantime, you can enable Site Isolation in Chrome by navigating to</p>\n<blockquote><p>chrome://flags/#enable-site-per-process</p></blockquote>\n<p>in the address bar of Chrome and clicking <strong>Enable</strong>. You will then need to relaunch Chrome. For FireFox, they have released <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2018-01/\">partial fixes in version 57.0.4</a> with additional fixes to be released on January 23rd. Beyond that, the normal precautions should be taken: only install apps (including those on your phones/tablets) from known, safe sources; don&#8217;t click on links in emails, sms text messages, online message boards, etc. that are from people you don&#8217;t know, or in situations where you weren&#8217;t expecting them; and apply updates for all of your devices as soon as they are available.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/plugins/"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/security/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"c1469af9-6114-57aa-b738-f6f9a76690ae","wordpress_id":17458,"slug":"vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-week-december-22-2017","path":"/blog/2017/12/vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-week-december-22-2017/","author":[{"id":"5be72c28-6949-53f8-b212-3feb5a9983de","path":"gilzow","display_name":"Paul Gilzow","email":"gilzowp@missouri.edu","twitter":"gilzow","website":"http://missouri.edu/","company":"University of Missouri","company_position":"Programmer Analyst","bio":"Web application security and accessibility evangelist.

The committer was <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/otto42\"><span class=\"s2\">Otto</span></a> so I’ll assume the WordPress plugin team removed the offending code and pushed the update.  Please make sure you have updated to 4.4.5 of the plugin and change the password on your admin accounts.  Also check for any additional user accounts that you do not recognize.  </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">This disclosure highlights (yet again), that the WordPress community really needs to think about the current state of how plugins are handled, and how we&#8217;re going to address plugin security as we head into 2018. There are over 50,000 plugins in the WordPress repository and only a handful of people on the plugin review team.  Even if they had 100 people on the review team, there&#8217;s no way they could feasibly review all code submissions in a timely manner.  I know many in the community would be unhappy adopting a Drupal-style review process, as that process takes much, much longer than what WordPress developers are used to.  However, this is the third (maybe fourth?) time this year we&#8217;ve seen a popular plugin shift to a new developer who introduces code for malicious intent. I&#8217;m hoping that the upcoming <a href=\"https://xwp.co/tide-a-path-to-better-code-across-the-wordpress-ecosystem/\">Tide project</a> will help in some way, but automated scans rarely are able to uncover all issues.   As a community, we need to drastically change the way we look at, and handle plugins.  When a third of the entire web relies on you, a nonchalant attitude toward security is no longer acceptable.</span></p>\n<h2>Other News</h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ll be out next week for the holiday break, so there will be no report next Friday.  I&#8217;ll release a two week report on January 5, 2018. I hope everyone has a <strong>fantastic</strong> holiday season.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/plugins/"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/security/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"aff7a298-3284-5cc7-8cd0-21353b108729","wordpress_id":17130,"slug":"vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-week-december-15-2017","path":"/blog/2017/12/vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-week-december-15-2017/","author":[{"id":"5be72c28-6949-53f8-b212-3feb5a9983de","path":"gilzow","display_name":"Paul Gilzow","email":"gilzowp@missouri.edu","twitter":"gilzow","website":"http://missouri.edu/","company":"University of Missouri","company_position":"Programmer Analyst","bio":"Web application security and accessibility evangelist.

I recently had the pleasure to chat with Andrew Scheifele (who had a hand in the DorkBot project) about how the service has worked for us and where the service is headed.  This past summer, Dorkbot (along with <a href=\"https://security.utexas.edu/apps-services\">several other technologies</a>) was <a href=\"https://www.saltycloud.com/2017/06/23/saltycloud-in-licences-cybersecurity-ip-from-ut-austin/\">licensed</a> to <a href=\"https://www.saltycloud.com/\">SaltyCloud,</a> a SaaS InfoSec company, and as of late this fall now serves over 300 campuses across the planet.  Andrew reassured me that SaltyCloud is committed to continuing to providing the DorkBot service to higher education institutions for no charge, though they may begin to offer value-added services on top of the DorkBot service.  They&#8217;re also looking to expand the current DorkBot offering to include (possibly) a dashboard to manage discovered vulnerabilities in your network.</p>\n<p>As I&#8217;ve mentioned before, we have been very pleased with the DorkBot service. We are a completely decentralized campus in terms of the web, and DorkBot has helped us to identify vulnerabilities in sites we didn&#8217;t even know existed.   For those of you in higher ed, I would encourage you to contact SaltyCloud (either through the <a href=\"https://www.saltycloud.com/dorkbot/\">company itself,</a> or through <a href=\"https://security.utexas.edu/dorkbot\">UT Austin</a>) and give the service a try.  If you do, I would <strong>love</strong> to hear from you about your experience.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/plugins/"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/security/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"8bbff3c2-cdaa-562d-99d8-6eda916fa827","wordpress_id":17055,"slug":"vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-week-december-8-2017","path":"/blog/2017/12/vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-week-december-8-2017/","author":[{"id":"5be72c28-6949-53f8-b212-3feb5a9983de","path":"gilzow","display_name":"Paul Gilzow","email":"gilzowp@missouri.edu","twitter":"gilzow","website":"http://missouri.edu/","company":"University of Missouri","company_position":"Programmer Analyst","bio":"Web application security and accessibility evangelist.

I hope XWP is able to open up the service shortly so the community can work toward improving the code quality of submitted code.</p>\n<h2>Other Security News</h2>\n<p>Right before Thanksgiving, the <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/\">OWASP foundation</a> <a href=\"https://owasp.blogspot.com/2017/11/owasp-is-pleased-to-announce-release-of.html\">announced</a> the release of the <a href=\"https://github.com/OWASP/Top10/tree/master/2017\">OWASP Top 10 2017 edition</a>.  Three new entries were added in this edition: <a href=\"https://github.com/OWASP/Top10/blob/master/2017/en/0xa8-insecure-deserialization.md\">A8-2017 Insecure Deserialization</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/OWASP/Top10/blob/master/2017/en/0xaa-logging-detection-response.md\">A10-2017 Insufficient Logging and Monitoring</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/OWASP/Top10/blob/master/2017/en/0xa4-xxe.md\">A4-2017 XML External Entities (XXE)</a>.

If your institution is like mine, they only patch servers once a month.  In this case, the patch was released after the patch window for October, and well before the window for November. I would encourage you to check your institution&#8217;s version to see what version you have installed and work with your system administrator(s) to do an emergency patch if you are running a vulnerable version.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/plugins/"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/security/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"3fd0f4fe-5ea3-5c15-a00a-b0e577f73452","wordpress_id":16688,"slug":"vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-week-november-3-2017","path":"/blog/2017/11/vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-week-november-3-2017/","author":[{"id":"5be72c28-6949-53f8-b212-3feb5a9983de","path":"gilzow","display_name":"Paul Gilzow","email":"gilzowp@missouri.edu","twitter":"gilzow","website":"http://missouri.edu/","company":"University of Missouri","company_position":"Programmer Analyst","bio":"Web application security and accessibility evangelist.

When <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vanderaj/status/919286279585480705\">I asked</a> about A8&#8217;s removal, the current project lead replied that it was number thirteen in their data set, and exploitable in 4% of pen test results.  In our internal audits of systems on campus, CSRF is a consistent, exploitable issue.  But then, higher education almost always lags behind the rest of the industry.  A3-2013 Cross-Site Scripting has been moved to position seven (A7-2017), and two new entries have been added: A4-2017 XML External Entity (XXE) and A10-2017 Insufficient Logging and Monitoring.  I won&#8217;t try to explain XXE as <a href=\"https://sensepost.com/blog/2014/revisting-xxe-and-abusing-protocols/\">this sensepost blog post</a> does a much better job than I could, but I am surprised this issue rose to the level of making it into the top 10.  I haven&#8217;t seen any XXE issues in our internal scans for some time.  A10-2017 Insufficient Logging and Monitoring was named A7-2017 Insufficient Attack Protection in the first Release Candidate and caused <a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/3192505/security/contrast-security-responds-to-owasp-top-10-controversy.html\">quite</a> <a href=\"http://www.skeletonscribe.net/2017/04/abusing-owasp.html\">a bit</a> of <a href=\"https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/2017-owasp-top-10-a7/\">drama</a> in the security community, despite Dave Wichers&#8217; excellent job of <a href=\"http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-topten/2017-April/001410.html\">explaining the intent </a>behind its entry. I&#8217;m glad they&#8217;ve renamed it to describe the issue more accurately, but it will be interesting to see if it is accepted by the security community.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/plugins/"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/security/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"59d8573a-8d75-5be9-aa18-a8cdd9ab8d2d","wordpress_id":16132,"slug":"vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-week-october-6-2017","path":"/blog/2017/10/vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-week-october-6-2017/","author":[{"id":"5be72c28-6949-53f8-b212-3feb5a9983de","path":"gilzow","display_name":"Paul Gilzow","email":"gilzowp@missouri.edu","twitter":"gilzow","website":"http://missouri.edu/","company":"University of Missouri","company_position":"Programmer Analyst","bio":"Web application security and accessibility evangelist.

The first is an authenticated arbitrary file upload vulnerability in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpbooklist/\">WordPress Book List </a>plugin, <a href=\"https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2017/10/02/authenticated-arbitrary-file-upload-vulnerability-in-wordpress-book-list/\">disclosed by pluginvulnerabilities.com.</a>  As for versions affected, they don&#8217;t list how far back the vulnerability goes. In looking back through the versions, it goes back to at least v5.0. There was a major code restructuring between 4.4 and 5.0, and it <em>appears</em> that the vulnerability was introduced at that point.</p>\n<p>Next are authenticated Object Injection and <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF)\">Cross-Site Request Forgery</a> vulnerabilities in the plugin Event List (which has been removed from the public plugin repository, also <a href=\"https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2017/10/06/authenticated-php-object-injection-vulnerability-in-event-list/\">disclosed by pluginvulnerabilities.com</a>.  In looking through the code, it appears the vulnerability was <a href=\"https://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/event-list/tags/0.7.3/admin/includes/admin-import.php\">introduced at version 0.7.3</a>. You are encouraged to remove the plugin.</p>\n<p>Last is both authenticated and unauthenticated <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Blind_SQL_Injection\">Blind SQL Injection</a> vulnerabilities in the plugin <a href=\"https://codecanyon.net/item/content-timeline-responsive-wordpress-plugin-for-displaying-postscategories-in-a-sliding-timeline/3027163\">Content Timeline</a>. According to the disclosure, the author of the plugin never responded. In looking at the <a href=\"http://www.shindiristudio.com/timelinewp/demo/wp-content/plugins/content_timeline/README.md\">readme file from the demo site,</a>  the last update was sometime in 2017, but doesn&#8217;t mention any changes related to SQL Injection. Therefore, the assumption is that the current version is still vulnerable. As this is a paid plugin, I would recommend contacting the vendor directly and ask if the vulnerabilities have been addressed.  If you do not receive a quick response, then I would recommend removing the plugin and finding an alternative solution.</p>\n<h2>Other Security News</h2>\n<p>Earlier this week, Curl, the popular command line tool for transfer data to or from a server, <a href=\"https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20171004.html\">released an update</a> to address a vulnerability where a malicious server could send a malformed response to a PWD command, causing curl to crash.  Affected versions are 7.7 up to and including 7.55.1. There are no known exploits targeting this vulnerability.</p>\n<p>Also revealed earlier this week, <a href=\"https://securitynews.io/2017/10/2013-yahoo-breach-3-billion/\">Yahoo now believes</a> that <strong>all</strong> accounts were affected in the <a href=\"https://threatpost.com/yahoo-discloses-data-from-1-billion-accounts-stolen-in-2013/122520/\">2013 breach</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Subsequent to Yahoo’s acquisition by Verizon, and during integration, the company recently obtained new intelligence and now believes, following an investigation with the assistance of outside forensic experts, that all Yahoo user accounts were affected by the August 2013 theft.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Essentially, if you had a Yahoo account prior to August 2013, your account was affected by the breach.  If you haven&#8217;t already done so, you really need to go <a href=\"https://login.yahoo.com/account/security?.lang=en-US&amp;.intl=us&amp;.src=yhelp\">change your password</a>.</p>\n<h2>HighEdWeb</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.highedweb.org/\">HighEdWeb</a>, <strong>the</strong> best conference for those of who work on the web and in higher education starts on Sunday! WPCampus will be there, as will many of our WPCampus community members (myself included).  I&#8217;ll be <a href=\"https://2017.highedweb.org/schedule/#WRK2\">teaching a hands-on workshop</a> on Sunday covering the <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project\">OWASP Top 10</a> and how to mitigate your risks. Last I checked there are still some seats available, so if you aren&#8217;t already committed on Sunday afternoon come join me.  Also, our very own <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bamadesigner\">Rachel Cherry</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cgrymala\">Curtiss Grymala</a> will be <a href=\"https://2017.highedweb.org/schedule/#WRK4\">teaching a workshop on WordPress in Higher Ed</a>. If you don&#8217;t come to my workshop, then I&#8217;d highly suggest attending theirs.  Either way, if you&#8217;ll be attending, definitely stop in the DPA (aka tech) track and say hello. I&#8217;d love to chat about security or WordPress!</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/plugins/"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/security/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"24b71c8c-7e83-563b-b4b9-4b4760844d25","wordpress_id":15940,"slug":"vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-week-september-29-2017","path":"/blog/2017/09/vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-week-september-29-2017/","author":[{"id":"5be72c28-6949-53f8-b212-3feb5a9983de","path":"gilzow","display_name":"Paul Gilzow","email":"gilzowp@missouri.edu","twitter":"gilzow","website":"http://missouri.edu/","company":"University of Missouri","company_position":"Programmer Analyst","bio":"Web application security and accessibility evangelist.

This means an attacker could upload a backdoor script to your site and then access it in your site&#8217;s /wp-content/uploads/ directory.  If you remember back to my <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/gilzow/access-denied-75716045\"><em>Access Denied</em> presentation</a>, this scenario is precisely why I suggest denying access to all file types in the uploads directory except for those you specifically want the public to have access to.  It is highly recommended that you remove this plugin immediately.</p>\n<p>While not in the report this week, I came across a <a href=\"http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/Google-dork-query\">google dork</a> <a href=\"https://www.exploit-db.com/ghdb/4544/\">entry</a> in exploit-db.com that targets the .user.ini file generated by  the WordFence plugin.  The .user.ini file contains a full path listing to the wordfence-waf.php file.  By default, the plugin should include an entry in the site&#8217;s .htaccess file to deny access to this file.  In addition, it should warn nginx user&#8217;s to include an entry in their configuration file.  However, it doesn&#8217;t appear that the plugin verifies an .htaccess file is actually in use, or that the nginx configuration has been made.  IIS users are simply out-of-luck with no warning or instructions on how to deny access to the file.  A quick <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=filetype%3Aini+%22wordfence%22&amp;oq=filetype%3Aini+%22wordfence%22&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i58j69i61&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">search</a> shows that there are quite a few sites out there using Wordfence with no protection against disclosing this information.   Now, the disclosure of the full path <em>by itself</em> won&#8217;t compromise your site. However, this information can be used in combination with other attacks that require knowing the server path.  Regardless, if you use Wordfence, I would suggest checking your site to see if you can access the .user.ini file.  If so, make sure to add the configuration changes needed in order to block it from public access. If you run into issues figuring out how to do so, reach out to me and I&#8217;ll assist.</p>\n<h2>WordPress Security News</h2>\n<p>In other WordPress security news, version 4.8.2 was <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/09/wordpress-4-8-2-security-and-maintenance-release/\">released</a> earlier this week.  4.8.2 <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.8.2\">addresses</a> nine security issues, and six maintenance issues.  Hopefully you have auto-updates enabled and have already received the update, but if not, you should update as soon as feasibly possible.</p>\n<h2>Other Security New</h2>\n<p>In other security news that might affect you, a new Apache vulnerability dubbed OptionsBleed was <a href=\"https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/60-Optionsbleed-HTTP-OPTIONS-method-can-leak-Apaches-server-memory.html\">disclosed</a> this week that affects versions of Apache 2.2.34 and earlier, and version 2.4.27 and earlier. Apache has <a href=\"https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/httpd/httpd/branches/2.4.x/server/core.c?r1=1805223&amp;r2=1807754&amp;pathrev=1807754&amp;view=patch\">released a patch</a> to fix the issue.  Without getting too technical, if a misconfiguration has occurred in a user&#8217;s web account, a malicious actor can send a request to the server, and due to the misconfiguration, Apache will leak contents from memory.  Since the misconfiguration can occur in the user&#8217;s account, a malicious actor could intentionally cause the misconfiguration in a shared hosting environment.  NakedSecurity has a <a href=\"https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2017/09/19/apache-optionsbleed-vulnerability-what-you-need-to-know/\">great write-up</a> if you&#8217;re interested in the technical specifics.  If you are on shared hosting, I would suggest talking to your host and make sure they have patched their systems.</p>\n<p>Next up, many of us use slack as a way to collaborate among workers, friends and community members.  Most often, those slack teams are meant only for people who should have access.  Researcher Inti De Ceukelaire recently <a href=\"https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-i-hacked-hundreds-of-companies-through-their-helpdesk-b7680ddc2d4c\">discovered</a> a way to bypass that gateway and gain access to many companies&#8217; internal communications by using their online ticket systems, or online help desk systems.  By using a company&#8217;s support email (e.g. support@company.com), he was then able to sign into a company&#8217;s slack channel.  He&#8217;s dubbed the bypass TicketTrick and unfortunately, the same issue affects Yammer and Facebook Workplace. As for remediation, one option is to make your team invite-only instead of basing it on company email. The other is to consider using different domain names for their email issue trackers and support help desks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/plugins/"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/security/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"5725b910-6d1b-57d9-890e-1984b5d34433","wordpress_id":15740,"slug":"vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-week-september-15-2017","path":"/blog/2017/09/vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-week-september-15-2017/","author":[{"id":"5be72c28-6949-53f8-b212-3feb5a9983de","path":"gilzow","display_name":"Paul Gilzow","email":"gilzowp@missouri.edu","twitter":"gilzow","website":"http://missouri.edu/","company":"University of Missouri","company_position":"Programmer Analyst","bio":"Web application security and accessibility evangelist.

I&#8217;ve also reached out to contacts at iThemes to make sure they know about the issue and see if they have addressed it. It&#8217;s also important to note that the vulnerabilities are only present in multisite, when the multisite support for Backupbuddy has been enabled.</p>\n<p>The other big disclosure occurred late Friday of last week concerning the <a href=\"http://strategy11.com/display-widgets/\">Display Widgets plugin</a>.  The original developer <a href=\"http://wpdevs.co.uk/sell-your-plugin/\"><strong>sold</strong> the plugin</a> to a new developer this summer. Shortly thereafter, code was included in the plugin that allowed the new developer to insert content into any site using the plugin (which had about 200K installs).   The plugin then went through several rounds of being removed from the repository, developer submitting a new version (with the malicious code still present) and the plugin being reinstated in the repository.  Finally, the plugin was removed for a fourth and final time late last Friday.  If you are using the Display Widgets you need to either <strong>remove it immediately</strong>, or downgrade to version 2.05 which was the last version before the plugin was taken over by the new developer.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this highlights one of the major issues with the current plugin repository: no security oversight in plugins that are submitted.  And as WordPress&#8217; market share continues to grow, the plugin repository will continue to be an attractive target for attackers, or in the case of this plugin, someone looking to use it for <a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2017/09/man-behind-plugin-spam-mason-soiza/\">blackhat SEO</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/plugins/"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/security/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"11bdc14d-5f4f-5743-87a8-f55bb4efa51d","wordpress_id":15491,"slug":"vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-september-8-2017","path":"/blog/2017/09/vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-september-8-2017/","author":[{"id":"5be72c28-6949-53f8-b212-3feb5a9983de","path":"gilzow","display_name":"Paul Gilzow","email":"gilzowp@missouri.edu","twitter":"gilzow","website":"http://missouri.edu/","company":"University of Missouri","company_position":"Programmer Analyst","bio":"Web application security and accessibility evangelist.

The TL;DR is</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Equifax</strong>, one of the “big-three” U.S. credit bureaus, said today a data breach at the company may have affected 143 million Americans, jeopardizing consumer Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses and some driver’s license numbers.</p></blockquote>\n<p>To put that in perspective, the U.S. population is just shy of <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/popclock/\">325 million</a>; this means 45% of the <strong>entire</strong> United States population is affected by this breach.  Given the numbers, there&#8217;s a very good chance you were involved in the leak.  Equifax has a <a href=\"https://trustedidpremier.com/eligibility/eligibility.html\">site set up</a> where you can <a href=\"https://trustedidpremier.com/eligibility/eligibility.html\">check to see</a> if your information was included in the leak. They are offering twelve months of credit monitoring service through TrustedID Premiere (interestingly, TrustedID is a wholly owned subsidary of Equifax).  However, before you enroll, be sure to read the <a href=\"https://trustedidpremier.com/static/terms\">terms of service</a> as enrolling waives your rights to sue, or be a member of a class-action suit against Equifax in the future. If you&#8217;re worried about not having the monitoring in place, read Krebs&#8217; article on <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/11/report-everyone-should-get-a-security-freeze/\">credit file freezes</a>.</p>\n<p>So far Equifax has not disclosed how the breach occurred, only that they discovered &#8220;unauthorized access&#8221; by &#8220;exploiting an application vulnerability.&#8221; While we do not know yet if WordPress was involved in the breach, it is interesting that the www.equifaxsecurity2017.com site is <a href=\"https://www.equifaxsecurity2017.com/wp-content/themes/sierra_2017/style.css\">running WordPress</a>, and up until a few hours ago, was still leaking user names via the user REST API endpoint.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-15641 aligncenter\" src=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/wp-content/uploads/equifax-users-800x167.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"167\" srcset=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/wp-content/uploads/equifax-users-800x167.jpg 800w, https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/wp-content/uploads/equifax-users-768x160.jpg 768w, https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/wp-content/uploads/equifax-users.jpg 908w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>Another <a href=\"https://lgtm.com/blog/apache_struts_CVE-2017-9805_announcement\">large disclosure</a> this week was with the <a href=\"https://struts.apache.org/\">Apache Struts framework</a> which involved an issue with the framework&#8217;s REST plugin, whereby arbitrary code execution could occur via unsafe deserialization. This is a critical vulnerability and you are encouraged to <a href=\"https://struts.apache.org/announce.html\">update</a> immediately if you are using Struts.  Deserialization is complicated to protect against, and is coming becoming a big enough issue that it <a href=\"https://github.com/OWASP/Top10/issues/92\">might be included</a> in the OWASP Top 10 for 2017.</p>\n<p>Speaking of the OWASP Top 10, yet another <a href=\"https://www.upguard.com/breaches/cloud-leak-tigerswan\">disclosure this week</a> highlighted why knowing how and where your sensitive data is being stored is so critical (<a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A6-Sensitive_Data_Exposure\">A6: Sensitive Data Exposure</a>).  A Researcher from Upguard discovered a publicly accessible AWS storage bucket containing 9,400 resumes from people who had applied for a job at TigerSwan, an international security company. However, the information wasn&#8217;t left in the storage bucket by TigerSwan, but by a recruiting vendor TigerSwan had previously hired.  Even if TigerSwan followed all best practices for securing data, sharing that data with a vendor who failed to do so has damaged their reputation, and more importantly, left the individuals who trusted them with their data vulnerable to identity theft.</p>\n<h2>Opportunities</h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in Application Security, tradepub.com is offering a couple of good security-related eBooks for free right now: <em><a href=\"http://webcodegeeks.tradepub.com/free/w_pacb47/\">Penetration Testing &#8211; A Survival Guide</a></em> and <em><a href=\"http://webcodegeeks.tradepub.com/free/w_aaaa5051/\">Web Application Security for Dummies</a></em>.

Also disclosed this week were <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/PHP_Object_Injection\">PHP Object Injection</a> vulnerabilities in the plugins <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/jayj-quicktag/\">JayJ Quicktag,</a> <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/videowhisper-live-streaming-integration/\">VideoWhisper Live Streaming</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-smart-security/\">WP Smart Security</a> (currently unfixed).  All three were discovered by researchers at <a href=\"https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/\">pluginvulnerabilities.com</a>. For the WP Smart Security vulnerability, they utilized the <a href=\"http://php-grinder.com/\">php-grinder.com</a> service. PHP-Grinder is a <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Static_Code_Analysis#Description\">static analysis</a> tool designed specially to scan WordPress plugins and PHP-based GitHub projects for potential security vulnerabilities.   If you&#8217;re new to static analysis, this is a great introduction to see how static analysis works.  In looking at the <a href=\"http://php-grinder.com/project/view/21868\">report</a> for WP Smart Security, we can see it <a href=\"http://php-grinder.com/vulns/view/3903988\">identified</a> a potentially insecure use of <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/function.unserialize.php\">unserialize</a> on line 20 of secure.php.  Looking at the source we find unserialize is being called on the contents of $HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA after being base64 decoded, which is definitely of concern.</p>\n<p>I was fortunate to use the initial 0.1 beta of php-grinder.com and have been extremely happy with the 0.2 version.  I would encourage you to test out your own plugins/projects for issues. If you decide to test any plugins that you use, and you do find a vulnerability, please be sure to communicate <em>immediately</em> with the author.

The fix is easy enough: at the beginning of the process, ensure the user is authorized.  Luckily, WordPress makes this easy for us through the function <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/current_user_can\">current_user_can()</a> which you can use to check to make sure the user has the needed capabilities (permissions) necessary to perform an action or access a resource.</p>\n<p><code><br />\nfunction my_awesome_function()<br />\n{<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if(current_user_can('edit_others_posts'){<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//do stuff<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br />\n}<br />\n</code></p>\n<p>Like many things in secure coding, the fix isn&#8217;t insurmountable, you just have to know what to do and remember to do it!</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/plugins/"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/security/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"2a4faac6-dae8-5830-ad44-5dbbc695d803","wordpress_id":15244,"slug":"vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-themes-report-august-18-2017","path":"/blog/2017/08/vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-themes-report-august-18-2017/","author":[{"id":"5be72c28-6949-53f8-b212-3feb5a9983de","path":"gilzow","display_name":"Paul Gilzow","email":"gilzowp@missouri.edu","twitter":"gilzow","website":"http://missouri.edu/","company":"University of Missouri","company_position":"Programmer Analyst","bio":"Web application security and accessibility evangelist.

As before, in most situations this will be someone with an administrator account who, if were a bad actor, could cause more damage in other ways.  But it once again highlights that we need to make sure people are given the minimum amount of privileges to perform their jobs, and as developers, ensure that we are parameterizing/binding <strong>all</strong> queries.</p>\n<p>The second one I want to highlight was discovered by researcher <a href=\"https://twitter.com/padannewitz\">Paul Dannewitz</a>, who discovered a SQL Injection vulnerability in the plugin <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/i-recommend-this/\">I Recommend This</a>. I Recommend This has over 40K active installs, and only requires a user to have a subscriber-level role. What&#8217;s particularly interesting about this exploit is that vulnerability is in the handling of data passed in via a shortcode. It&#8217;s an excellent example how as a developer, you can&#8217;t trust data from <em>any</em> source.</p>\n<h2>Other Security News</h2>\n<p>Drupal released an <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/SA-CORE-2017-004\">update</a> yesterday that addressed one critical vulnerability and two moderately critical vulnerabilities in the 8.X branch, and an <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/node/2902604\">update</a> to the Views module for sites on the 7.X branch.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alertlogic.com/\">Alert Logic</a> released their <a href=\"https://www.alertlogic.com/assets/industry-reports/alertlogic-cloud-security-report-2017.pdf\">2017 Cloud Security Report</a> earlier this week. During an 18 month period, they tracked over 2 million security incidents, from 3800 customers.  While ransomware has certainly been making the headlines, it was web application attacks that made up almost 75% of those tracked incidents with SQL Injection attacks making up just over half, leading Alert Logic to state:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Web applications are the soft underbelly of your organization – the number-one means by which attackers breach data.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Many of the web applications attacks targeted third-party components (i.e. plugins and themes) which, as developers, is on us.  If you are creating custom plugins or themes, <strong>please</strong> set aside some time to go through some secure coding tutorials.  If you&#8217;ll be attending <a href=\"https://2017.highedweb.org\">HighEdWeb</a> this year (and I highly recommend it) come take my security-focused <a href=\"https://2017.highedweb.org/schedule/\">pre-conference workshop</a>.  Check out the <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Secure_Coding_Practices_-_Quick_Reference_Guide\">OWASP Secure Coding Practices quick reference guide</a>, or look into some tutorials over at <a href=\"https://www.lynda.com/Programming-Foundations-tutorials/Introduction-secure-coding/418266/450307-4.html\">lynda.com</a>. It&#8217;s up to us to step up our game and help secure the web.</p>\n<p>Speaking of ransomware, <a href=\"https://wordfence.com/\">Wordfence</a> put out <a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2017/08/ransomware-wordpress/\">an interesting post</a> about a new ransomeware that&#8217;s targeting WordPress specifically.  From reading the article, it appears that after compromising the site (WordFence fails to say how the sites are initially compromised), the site is then encrypted and held ransom until the owner pays the ransom.  The best way to protect yourself is the same as always: keep WordPress core, your plugins and your themes up-to-date, be skeptical of any third-party code you add to your site, and lock as many things down as possible.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://sucuri.net/\">Sucuri</a> did a f<a href=\"https://blog.sucuri.net/2017/08/how-to-restore-website-backups-from-the-command-line.html\">ollow-up post</a> to their post last week on backing up your site using command-line tools: <em><a href=\"https://blog.sucuri.net/2017/08/how-to-restore-website-backups-from-the-command-line.html\">How to Restore Website Backups from the Command Line</a></em>.

One of the interesting items was the increased attacks on <a href=\"https://wp-rocket.me/\">wp-rocket</a> which had a Local File Inclusion vulnerability disclosed at the end of July (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zTfpdEKzquGdk6y7lztnt0E18yZLe_8hH5V1AFN4474/edit?usp=sharing\">see the July 28th Vulnerable Plugins Report</a>). This highlights how critical it is to keep your plugins up-to-date as attackers are most definitely targeting these vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>Next, <a href=\"https://sucuri.net/\">Sucuri</a> did a great <a href=\"https://blog.sucuri.net/2017/08/website-backups-using-command-line-tools.html\">post</a> earlier this week on creating website backups with no plugins, just ssh + command line tools. Having a good, clean back up of your files and database is a <em>critical</em>, yet often over-looked component of a solid security strategy.  If you already have a plugin that creates scheduled backups and stores them offsite (please don&#8217;t store your backups on the same server as your website), then you are one step ahead of most. However, if you&#8217;ve ever been in the situation where a plugin won&#8217;t work, or you can&#8217;t find one that supports storing to a particular storage service, you don&#8217;t necessarily <strong>need</strong> a plugin.  By using ssh and some <a href=\"https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Bash_Shell_Scripting\">bash scripting</a> you can back up your site(s) and store them to any service needed.  Definitely check out their post and don&#8217;t be afraid to get your hands dirty in the terminal!</p>\n<h2>Other Security News</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/\">PostgreSQL</a> released <a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/1772/\">critical updates</a> yesterday for all of their supported versions (9.6.X, 9.5.X, 9.4.X, 9.3.X, and 9.2.X).  The update addresses three vulnerabilities: e<a href=\"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-7546\">mpty passwords accepted as valid in certain authentication methods</a>, <a href=\"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-7547\">information disclosure</a>, and <a href=\"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-7548\">privilege escalation.</a>  If you administer a system that runs PostgreSQL, you are encouraged to update as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://apache.org/\">Apache Software Foundation</a> also released critical updates yesterday for the <a href=\"https://subversion.apache.org/\">Subversion client.</a>  The updates address two vulnerabilities: <a href=\"https://subversion.apache.org/security/CVE-2016-8734-advisory.txt\">denial of service attack</a>, and <a href=\"https://subversion.apache.org/security/CVE-2017-9800-advisory.txt\">arbitrary code execution</a>. These vulnerabilities are particularly interesting because the attacks target subversion <em>clients</em> not necessarily the subversion server, with the code execution being especially concerning:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;A maliciously constructed svn+ssh:// URL would cause Subversion clients to run an arbitrary shell command. Such a URL could be generated by a malicious server, by a malicious user committing to a[sic] honest server (to attack another user of that server&#8217;s repositories), or by a proxy server.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>You&#8217;ll need to update your subversion client, which could prove interesting if your subversion client is embedded in your IDE, or the package you use sits on top of subversion&#8217;s client.  You&#8217;ll need to check with your vendor for an update.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/plugins/"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/security/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"b9569a9b-7832-578c-95c2-4fa41c1693ae","wordpress_id":15000,"slug":"vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-august-4-2017","path":"/blog/2017/08/vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-august-4-2017/","author":[{"id":"5be72c28-6949-53f8-b212-3feb5a9983de","path":"gilzow","display_name":"Paul Gilzow","email":"gilzowp@missouri.edu","twitter":"gilzow","website":"http://missouri.edu/","company":"University of Missouri","company_position":"Programmer Analyst","bio":"Web application security and accessibility evangelist.

How?  The University of Missouri consistently use sites/services like <a href=\"https://crt.sh/\">crt.sh</a> to watch for new ssl certs that have been generated for our organizations, and sites like <a href=\"https://domainpunch.com/premium/wordmon.php\">domainpunch.com</a> to monitor domains that are being registered using one of our trademarks.  Attackers have access to these same tools, and watch for new domains.  They can then target those sites and try to begin the installation process before the site owner. But how can we use this same attack vector on an existing site?  That&#8217;s exactly how the researcher of last week&#8217;s WooCommerce Extra Product Options plugin disclosure <a href=\"http://wphutte.com/woocommerce-extra-product-options-rce-exploit-with-stored-xss-2/\">approached his research</a>. By looking for (and finding) an arbitrary file deletion vulnerability, he then can delete the wp-config file which allows him to go through the WordPress set-up stage again, ultimately taking over the site. I strongly encourage you to read his post.</p>\n<p>In a similar vein, the researcher behind several disclosures back in April <a href=\"https://blogs.akamai.com/2017/08/larrys-cabinet-of-web-vulnerability-curiosities.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+TheAkamaiBlog+%28The+Akamai+Blog%29\">reveals</a> how he approached and found vulnerabilities in multiple WordPress plugins.  Again, if security research is of interest to you, I highly recommend you read his post.</p>\n<h2>Other Security News</h2>\n<p>For those of you who may be using or supporting <a href=\"https://www.phpbb.com\">phpBB</a>, make sure you are on the latest version (<a href=\"https://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=14&amp;t=2430926\">3.2.1 &#8211; released July 17, 2017</a>) as the disclosure behind the Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability was <a href=\"http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/Aug/7\">released today</a>.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/plugins/"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/security/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"a78dc40f-e485-545e-9494-551b0addc598","wordpress_id":13687,"slug":"vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-july-28-2017","path":"/blog/2017/07/vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-report-july-28-2017/","author":[{"id":"5be72c28-6949-53f8-b212-3feb5a9983de","path":"gilzow","display_name":"Paul Gilzow","email":"gilzowp@missouri.edu","twitter":"gilzow","website":"http://missouri.edu/","company":"University of Missouri","company_position":"Programmer Analyst","bio":"Web application security and accessibility evangelist.

At the time, the plugin was removed from the public repository. The author has since released a fix, but the fix doesn&#8217;t entirely resolve the issue.  Unfortunately, they are relying on the reported file type ($_FILES[&#8216;fileupload&#8217;][&#8216;type&#8217;]) but this value isn&#8217;t reliable as it is set by the browser and can therefore be altered.  To the author&#8217;s credit, they are now adding <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/function.mt-rand.php\">mt_rand</a> to the file name and are now storing it in the <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/function.sys-get-temp-dir.php\">system temp directory</a>.  This does makes the uploaded file less accessible but unfortunately doesn&#8217;t truly restrict the file types being uploaded.  This vulnerability could be combined with a Local File Inclusion vulnerability to regain access to the uploaded files.  In addition, it appears that the script allows unauthorized users to generate an email and will attach the uploaded files to the email it generates, meaning an attacker could upload a payload for outlook and have the script email it to the victim.</p>\n<p><a class=\"button expand\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zTfpdEKzquGdk6y7lztnt0E18yZLe_8hH5V1AFN4474/edit?usp=sharing\">View this week&#8217;s vulnerable plugin list.</a></p>\n<h2>Other Security News</h2>\n<p>If you are using <a href=\"https://www.joomla.org/\">Joomla!</a> and are still on version 3.7.3 or earlier, you should strongly consider updating to <a href=\"https://www.joomla.org/announcements/release-news/5710-joomla-3-7-4-release.html\">3.7.4</a> (released earlier this week) as it addresses a <a href=\"https://vuldb.com/?id.104509\">Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability</a> contained in the older versions.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/plugins/"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/security/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"8e69c727-f391-51f6-9aa1-bb71cd5fc534","wordpress_id":13205,"slug":"vulnerable-plugins-report-july-13-2017","path":"/blog/2017/07/vulnerable-plugins-report-july-13-2017/","author":[{"id":"5be72c28-6949-53f8-b212-3feb5a9983de","path":"gilzow","display_name":"Paul Gilzow","email":"gilzowp@missouri.edu","twitter":"gilzow","website":"http://missouri.edu/","company":"University of Missouri","company_position":"Programmer Analyst","bio":"Web application security and accessibility evangelist.

The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/formcraft-form-builder/\">version in the public repository</a> definitely contains the vulnerability, but its directory is named &#8220;formcraft-form-builder&#8221;.  <a href=\"http://formcraft-wp.com/\">FormCraft</a> also offers a <a href=\"https://codecanyon.net/item/formcraft-premium-wordpress-form-builder/5335056?ref=ncrafts\">premium paid version</a> but as best I can tell, its directory is named &#8220;formcraft3&#8221;. It&#8217;s possible there is yet another &#8220;basic&#8221; version, but I have not been able to locate it so far.  In either case, the vulnerability is definitely present in the public version.  Given the last update was seven months ago, you might consider looking into alternative form builders as a replacement.</p>\n<p>The other plugin I want to bring attention to is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-statistics/\">WP Statistics</a> which also contained a SQL Injection vulnerability (<a href=\"https://blog.sucuri.net/2017/06/sql-injection-vulnerability-wp-statistics.html\">disclosed</a> by <a href=\"https://sucuri.net/\">Sucuri</a> earlier today).  The developer released an update to correct the issue so it is strongly encouraged that you update as soon as possible.</p>\n<p><a class=\"button expand\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sMEXTbouFWLQZgU31DKMION-iuadrfBlAqBOuizCji0/edit?usp=sharing\">View this week’s vulnerable plugins list</a></p>\n<h2>Other Security News</h2>\n<p>A <a href=\"http://www.digitalcitizensalliance.org/clientuploads/directory/Reports/DigitalCitizens_CollegeInfoTheft.pdf\">report</a> from the <a href=\"http://www.digitalcitizensalliance.org/\">Digital Citizens Alliance</a> was released back in March titled <em>Cyber Criminals, College Credentials, and the Dark Web: A Security Challenge Facing U.S. University Communities</em>. It has been on my &#8220;to-read&#8221; list for awhile and I finally had an opportunity to dig into it.  Researchers tracked how many *.edu accounts from the top 300 Higher Education Institutions were available for sale on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_web\">Dark Web</a>.</p>\n<p>Note: before you read the report, you need to take some of the information with a grain of salt. The numbers they present were gathered over a period of eight years, and none of the credentials have been verified for authenticity.  In terms of selling credentials on the dark web, we&#8217;re dealing with criminals here.  It would not be outside the realm of possibility for them to throw in some fake credentials to pad what they&#8217;re selling.</p>\n<p>As I have mentioned before, the .edu domain is extremely valuable to attackers as the domain is limited in who can use them.  *.edu credentials are particularly valuable as many companies offer students discounts on products and verify their student status through a *.edu email address.  Even more important, a *.edu credential opens the doors into a university&#8217;s network.  From there they can target the university&#8217;s internal infrastructure as well as classified and proprietary research data.</p>\n<p>We (<a href=\"http://missouri.edu/\">University of Missouri</a>) made it to #76 with 34K credentials, and a ratio of 75% (available credentials to current student + staff + faculty numbers).</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-13145\" src=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/wp-content/uploads/image001.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"548\" height=\"74\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-13146\" src=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/wp-content/uploads/image003.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"509\" height=\"27\" /></p>\n<p>As I mentioned above, these credentials have not been verified, so that number may very well be greatly inflated. However, even if only 10% are legitimate, that&#8217;s 3,400 credentials. That&#8217;s still a lot of entry points into our systems.  I would certainly encourage you to read the report, see where you rank and then use it to begin conversations with the various groups on your campus.</p>\n<h2>Dorkbot</h2>\n<p>The other item I want to mention is the <a href=\"https://security.utexas.edu/dorkbot\">Dorkbot</a> program out of the <a href=\"https://www.utexas.edu/\">University of Texas at Austin</a>.  We&#8217;ve been working with them for a couple of weeks and I have been <strong>extremely</strong> impressed with the results.  The service crawls your publicly available web presence (after you sign up, and with your permission) for vulnerabilities, and then sends a notice to your campus/institution&#8217;s Information Security Officer.  They have helped us identify numerous vulnerable applications that we were unaware of, and have been able to go back and remediate.  If your institution is not already a participant, I highly recommend you talk to your institution&#8217;s security office about joining their program.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/plugins/"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/security/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"cf194985-16da-514b-9fbf-7701122324eb","wordpress_id":12921,"slug":"vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-6-23-2017","path":"/blog/2017/06/vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-6-23-2017/","author":[{"id":"5be72c28-6949-53f8-b212-3feb5a9983de","path":"gilzow","display_name":"Paul Gilzow","email":"gilzowp@missouri.edu","twitter":"gilzow","website":"http://missouri.edu/","company":"University of Missouri","company_position":"Programmer Analyst","bio":"Web application security and accessibility evangelist.

In this case, it gives the user the ability to potentially read any file the (web host) site user account has access to.  This could be other files stored in the host account outside of the WordPress installation, other accounts files (if the host hasn&#8217;t isolated accounts from each other properly), all the way to the system passwd file.</p>\n<p><a class=\"button expand\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dZhEAHmIe9FzbcNiDZy2UCTMuhFfT04KopC8dJGiIlM/edit?usp=sharing\">View this week&#8217;s vulnerable plugins list</a></p>\n<h2>Other Security News</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://apache.org/\">Apache</a> released version 2.4.26 of the <a href=\"https://httpd.apache.org/\">Apache Web Server</a> earlier this week which addressed several critical vulnerabilities: <a href=\"https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/f4515e580dfb6eeca589a5cdebd4c4c709ce632b12924f343c3b7751@%3Cdev.httpd.apache.org%3E\">mod_mime buffer overread</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/55a068b6a5eec0b3198ae7d96a7cb412352d0ffa7716612c5af3745b@%3Cdev.httpd.apache.org%3E\">ap_find_token buffer overread</a>, and <a href=\"https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/8409e41a8f7dd9ded37141c38df001be930115428c3d64f70bbdb8b4@%3Cdev.httpd.apache.org%3E\">ap_get_basic_auth_pw authentication bypass</a> and <a href=\"https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/84bf7fcc5cad35d355f11839cbdd13cbc5ffc1d34675090bff0f96ae@%3Cdev.httpd.apache.org%3E\">mod_ssl null pointer dereference</a>. Users of 2.4.X are strongly encouraged to upgrade to 2.4.6.  These vulnerabilities also affect the 2.2.X branch and are encouraged to either apply patches to address each vulnerability, or upgrade to 2.2.33 as soon as it is released.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://securityweekly.com/2017/06/20/tsw6/\">Episode number six</a> of <a href=\"https://securityweekly.com/category/tsw/\">Tradecraft Security Weekly</a> covers finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in a WordPress site using <a href=\"https://wpscan.org/\">WPScan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.metasploit.com/\">Metasploit</a> (both of which are included in <a href=\"https://www.blackarch.org/\">BlackArch</a> which I discussed <a href=\"https://dev5290.wpcampus.org/2017/06/vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-6-16-2017/\">last week</a>). It&#8217;s definitely worth a watch/listen if you are interested in WordPress security.</p>\n<p>For our Drupal friends, Drupal <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/SA-CORE-2017-003\">released an update </a>for both the 7.X and 8.X branches that addresses one critical vulnerability (remote code execution), one moderately critical vulnerability (access bypass for uploaded files) and one less critical vulnerability. Administrators are encouraged to update as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>Last, I&#8217;m excited to see that <a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/\">Wordfence</a> has <a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2017/06/abandoned-removed-plugin-alerts/\">added</a> a Removed Plugin alert to their security plugin (though they are <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/no-longer-in-directory/\">not the first</a> to offer this service). I have always been of the opinion that WordPress should notify you when you are using a plugin that is no longer available in the public repository (though the WordPress core team <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/ideas/topic/alert-when-installed-plugins-have-been-removed-from-the-plugin-directory/page/2#post-30439\">disagrees</a>).  Currently, if you are using a plugin in your site that has been removed from the public repository, for any reason, as the site owner you do not receive a notification of any kind. This means you could be running a plugin that has an actively exploited vulnerability, or a plugin that has been abandoned.  As an administrator you <strong>need</strong> to know when a plugin&#8217;s status has changed so you can make an informed decision about what to do.  It&#8217;s one of the main reasons why I started the vulnerable plugins report to begin with: so site owners have <em>some</em> indication of when a plugin they are using has an issue.  Given Wordfence&#8217;s install base, I applaud Wordfence for including this information in the free version of their plugin to get this vital information out to as many people as possible.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/plugins/"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/security/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"6873bc0c-f6a1-58d2-b983-7408f4bdfd21","wordpress_id":12774,"slug":"vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-6-16-2017","path":"/blog/2017/06/vulnerable-wordpress-plugins-6-16-2017/","author":[{"id":"5be72c28-6949-53f8-b212-3feb5a9983de","path":"gilzow","display_name":"Paul Gilzow","email":"gilzowp@missouri.edu","twitter":"gilzow","website":"http://missouri.edu/","company":"University of Missouri","company_position":"Programmer Analyst","bio":"Web application security and accessibility evangelist.

He then later echoes that data back out to the browser without any escaping, leaving the code, and more importantly the user, open to <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF)\">Cross-Site Scripting</a> vulnerabilities.  An attacker could therefore combine these two vulnerabilities to steal an Admin&#8217;s session IDs on a target WordPress site.</p>\n<h2>Other News</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.blackarch.org/\">BlackArch</a> released the <a href=\"https://www.blackarch.org/downloads.html\">latest version</a> of their PentTesting toolkit yesterday.  It now contains over <a href=\"https://www.blackarch.org/tools.html\">1800 tools</a> of which are several WordPress-specific tools, including one that I&#8217;ve been playing with  recently, <a href=\"https://github.com/m4ll0k/WPSeku\">WPSeku</a>.  As a general WordPress scanning tool, I still find <a href=\"https://wpscan.org/\">WPScan</a> to contain more immediately-usable information, but WPSeku allows you to define a target file and a collection of parameters that you can then have it <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Fuzzing\">fuzz</a> against for <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection\">SQL Injection</a>, Cross-Site Scripting and Local File Inclusion vulnerabilities.  From a development standpoint, I&#8217;ve been using it to test against my own themes/plugins as a tertiary way to make sure I haven&#8217;t overlooked or missed something.  Install it locally, or grab the <a href=\"http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/blackarch.org/blackarch/ova/blackarch-linux-2016.12.24-x86_64.ova\">OVA virtual machine image</a> of BlackArch and start testing against your local development instance of your sites and see what you discover.</p>\n","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"9321c84b-1d3a-5fe6-8ea5-e74a5f409aad","wordpress_id":58,"count":109,"name":"Plugins","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/plugins/"},{"id":"2b3b6db2-5475-53a0-af10-92a53817aa73","wordpress_id":59,"count":114,"name":"Security","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/security/"}]}}]},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"siteName":"WPCampus: Where WordPress meets higher education"}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["2186475492"]}
