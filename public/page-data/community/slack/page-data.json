We value your wisdom and experience as much as any other member.</p>\n<p><strong>However, you are not allowed to use our Slack workspace to send “cold” messages and sell your product.</strong></p>\n<p>We encourage you to join conversations and follow along. If someone mentions your product or a need for your product, respond (in public) and let them know you’re available to help and they can send you a message if interested. This allows the other members to take the initiative</p>\n<p>We recommend that vendors <a href=\"https://slack.com/help/articles/201398467\">set up Slack keyword notifications</a> for their product names, and other related terms, so they can quickly join relevant discussions.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"wpc-slack__section\">\n<h2 id=\"language\">Inclusive language</h2>\n<p>Every kind of communication can lead to misunderstandings, especially when the communication is primarily virtual and consists of mostly text. Slack conversations can easily lack nuance, like nonverbal cues, facial expressions, and body language. While emojis, GIFs, etc. can help, Slack’s format makes it all too easy to write in a way that can confuse intent and unintentionally marginalize or ostracize individuals or groups.</p>\n<h3>Our Slackbot</h3>\n<p>We’ve customized our Slack account so we can easily share a reminder when we feel a member has communicated in a way that may marginalize another member.</p>\n<p>Reminders won’t appear all the time, but if one is added to your conversation, please understand that it is not meant to blame or shame. We recognize that the majority of instances are not intentional and are most likely born from habit. These reminders are a nudge in the direction of continually improving our community, to better support our diverse population, and to include all voices in the conversation.</p>\n<h3>Our guidelines</h3>\n<p>The following guidelines help us maintain an environment of respect and mutuality while communicating with each other:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People-first_language\">people-first</a> language, meaning in your word order. For example, instead of talking about your blind friend, refer to them as your friend who is blind. In fact, avoid sharing others’ personal characteristics (gender, race, religion, ethnicity, physicality, etc.) unless they’re directly pertinent to the conversation. Before disclosing this information, ask yourself how it advances the conversation for others to know your friend is blind at this moment?</li>\n<li>Refer to others in the same way they talk about themselves. This includes their pronouns, preferred name, and other aspects of their identity. If you’re unsure, you can refer to their Slack profile, <a href=\"https://slack.com/help/articles/202528808\">search Slack</a> for context in prior conversations (“@[username]” or “from:@[username]”), or ask for clarification in a private message.</li>\n<li>Avoid talking about others as victims. Phrases like “suffering with” or “challenged by” may seem more polite than other options, but they can encourage or foster pity or condescension toward the person described by your language as well as shame or embarrassment on the part of that person. As in previous bullet points, put the person and their perspective first. Ask yourself whether you know enough about the other person’s situation to judge whether, in the context of your conversation, they are disadvantaged.</li>\n<li>While using terms like “crazy” or “insane” are common colloquially, doing so can minimize the impact of mental health. When describing the intensity of a situation, use terms like “strenuous”, “incredible”, “lucky”, “unlikely”, or “atypical” instead. Similarly, describing circumstances as “normal” or “basic” can unintentionally shame those experiencing them otherwise.</li>\n<li>Be mindful of the diversity within our group. Instead of greeting people with a “Hi, guys,” consider “Hello, everyone.” Coming up with an appropriate alternative term is welcome, <i>e.g.</i> “earthlings” or “Truck Sheepers”. Instead of making the claim that “we all love karaoke,” stick with “many of us love karaoke.”</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>For more on inclusive language</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://open.buffer.com/inclusive-language-tech/\">https://open.buffer.com/inclusive-language-tech/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People-first_language\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People-first_language</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"wpc-slack__section\">\n<h2 id=\"report\">If you witness or are subject to unacceptable behavior</h2>\n<p>Any and all interactions in our community, including our Slack account, are governed by our <a href=\"/about/guidelines/conduct/\">Code of Conduct</a>.
