Connecting over 1,000 members, the WPCampus Slack is a great resource for asking questions, finding solutions, sharing information, helping others, planning community initiatives, and forming valuable connections and friendships.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"/learning/library/\">Learning Library</a></h2>\n<p>The WPCampus Learning Library is a growing collection of knowledge shared by members of the WPCampus community. The Library includes slides, videos, and discussion from sessions presented at <a href=\"https://www.dev5290.wpcampus.org/conferences\">WPCampus conferences</a>. Feel free to explore and leave questions for presenters.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"/learning/audit/\">Gutenberg audit</a></h2>\n<p>In late 2018, WPCampus released a <a href=\"https://www.dev5290.wpcampus.org/blog/2018/10/gutenberg-a11y-audit-rfp/\">request for proposals</a> to conduct an accessibility audit of the WordPress Gutenberg editor. <a href=\"https://www.dev5290.wpcampus.org/blog/2019/01/gutenberg-audit-vendor/\">Our vendor was selected</a> and our final fundraising goal was set at $31,200. On April 29, 2019, <a href=\"https://tenon.io/\">Tenon LLC</a> provided the final audit report to WPCampus. As of May 1, 2019, <a href=\"https://www.dev5290.wpcampus.org/blog/2019/05/gutenberg-audit-results\">all documents provided by Tenon are now available</a>. This audit is intended to help higher education institutions, and the whole WordPress community, make informed decisions about when and how to upgrade to the new editor.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"/learning/accessibility/\">Accessibility resources</a></h2>\n<p>The WPCampus community crowdfunded an extensive list of accessibility information, tools, and resources.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"/learning/speaking/\">Speaker training</a></h2>\n<p>WPCampus aims to prioritize and promote diversity in the general community, and in its events. One of the best ways to ensure a broad representation – and to encourage even more – is to have diverse speakers. We understand that there are plenty of reasons why marginalized populations may not be the first to sign up to speak. A lack of opportunity, inexperience, struggles with imposter syndrome, and general nerves may all contribute to apathy or avoidance of public speaking. This training aims to help alleviate these issues and encourages participants to imagine how they can contribute to the larger conversation.</p>\n","wpc_seo":{"title":"","meta":{"description":"WPCampus Slack The majority of WPCampus conversations and interactions take place in our Slack workspace.
