One of the best ways to ensure a broad representation &#8211; and to encourage even more &#8211; is to have diverse speakers.</p>\n<p>That said, we understand that there are plenty of reasons why marginalized populations may not be the first to sign up to speak. A lack of opportunity, inexperience, struggles with imposter syndrome, and general nerves may all contribute to apathy or an avoidance of public speaking. This training aims to help alleviate these issues and encourages participants to imagine how they can contribute to the larger conversation.</p>\n<h2>Content</h2>\n<p>This training is taught in two parts:</p>\n<h3>Part I</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Finding a topic for your talk</li>\n<li>Writing the pitch for your talk</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Part I will discuss some of the obstacles to public speaking and help identify some ways to overcome them. It goes on to help participants identify areas of interest for speaking, and helps construct a pitch and bio to get you everything you need to apply to speak.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ncsu.zoom.us/recording/play/8k5c7OsnXqkJbpTH8Y90m_Enkf3JJxbJz624HT3CLkNQhzUAR-iSekgAkAUuZurJ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Watch the recording</strong></a><br />\n<a href=\"https://go.ncsu.edu/speaker-training\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>View the slides</strong></a></p>\n<h3>Part II</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Creating your talk</li>\n<li>Becoming a better speaker</li>\n<li>Creating great slides</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Part II takes the next step in constructing your talk and planning your presentation.
