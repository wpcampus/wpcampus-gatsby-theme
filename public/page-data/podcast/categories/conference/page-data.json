A podcast for those who use WordPress in higher education. My name is Brian DeConinck, and I'm joined by Jen McFarland.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> [crosstalk] podcast recording expert.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Jen says she's not feeling funny today, so she didn't sing any theme music for us.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Well also I have a new mic. It's really fancy. I don't want you guys to actually be able to hear the quality of my voice. So I'm going to hold off on the singing for a little while.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> We are at some point going to try to really reach epic professionalism standards by buying or using some free, with-attribution music to start these sessions off. That's going to happen.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> So if you are a longtime listener, of which there might be one, possibly two of you.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Our moms.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> You know that the last couple of episodes have been a little shorter, a little looser. And that's a deliberate choice on our part.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> This episode is going to be even less structured, because we don't have a guest and we didn't really decide what we're going to talk about.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, you guys are along for a ride.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> So this is sort of a pre-conference summertime fun-time catch up on everything happening in the WordPress world, slash fill time until two weeks from now when we actually have a guest.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah. If you guys aren't listening to this at the pool, you should be, because this is summertime fun-time.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> It is summertime fun-time. Is today the first day of summer, this day that we're recording it? Something like that?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> I thought it was like the 22nd.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Let's just pretend it's whatever day [crosstalk].\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, whatever day you're listening to it today is summer.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> So what's new in the your life, slash WordPress world, Jen?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Probably the big news this week, at least to start, is it was WordCamp EU last week, weekend. So we got to hear from our intrepid spirit animal Matt Mullenweg about the future course of WordPress.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> I did not actually watch his speech. We usually do that. But I confess, I lost track of time. I forgot that it was EU already. And so then all of a sudden I get my alerts and my updates and my newsletters and I'm like, \"Oh dang, look at Matt's talking,\" and I missed it.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Yeah, I was busy moving across the country. But I did go back and read all of David Bisset's Tweets during [crosstalk].\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Okay well that's like the same thing, right?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Yeah it's basically the same thing as watching it live. So yeah, so ...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> I did the WPTavern recaps, so that's the same thing, right?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Yeah. So the big news to come out of that is not really anything that's big newsy. There were some demos of phase two of Gutenbergy-type things. The navigation block, navigation menu block. But there wasn't like a firm timetable. Which I guess ...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah. I was definitely looking for more information on Gutenberg phase two timeline. Because we'd like to use some of that stuff, or start to be thinking about using it.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> And my takeaway was, what I think Matt said towards the end, \"This is a process. It's going to be 10 years in the making.\" Which did not make me feel good about a release in the next couple of months, let's say.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Or I guess there will be releases, but not really feeling like those releases are going to be ... Not really knowing what's going to be in them. Yeah.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, or not feeling like they're going to be pulled into Core for a little while yet.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Right, right. But that's fun. Some cool stuff. Also fun is that there was question about accessibility during the Q&amp;A period. And we got a WPCampus accessibility audit shout-out.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Woo!\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> So now the whole world knows about us. So if you're listening to this podcast because of that shout-out, please register for the in-person even in Portland. July 25th through something?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, the 25th to the 27th. Great conversion there, Brian. I'm really impressed with your ... We should work on some marketing, some sly marketing moves [crosstalk] those.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Yeah. You know, you can learn more at 2019.dev5290.wpcampus.org.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> That's good stuff. Okay, any other takeaways from ... Oh, I thought it was interesting that, what did they say? 21 of the 24 current Democrat candidates for President are using WordPress for their election sites. So yay politics?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> I guess.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> The only big news I've heard in politics in a while.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> I guess now we need to figure out who those other three are, and ...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> [crosstalk].\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> ... either vote for them or not vote ... I don't know what action [inaudible].\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> I need an action out of here. Go and see what they're using?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Run their websites through WAVE and see if they're accessible.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, we should do that for all 24 and see what kind of damage that is.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> That's actually, I might do that.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Now Brian has something to do for the weekend. Great. Okay.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> So sort of related to our topic a few weeks ago about diversity and inclusion, but there was the WordCamp Europe after-party event that people had feelings about. I don't know if you saw all that on Twitter or not, and [inaudible].\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> No, I missed that. Please.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> There was an after-party. So during the after-party, there were performers, there were sort of cover bands. They were covering different artists and they were sort of performing as those artists. And dressed up as them and things like that.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> And apparently there was a ...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Oh no.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Apparently there was a performer who was a woman who also started taking clothes off. And that was unexpected. And the reaction of some men in the crowd was not what you would call inclusive. So conferences are hard.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, I guess. I didn't hear about any drama.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Yeah, so the WordCamp Europe people, to their credit, put out an apology about that. But I mean, I think ...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Were they apologizing for the band or the people?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> I think they were apologizing for the performance not being what they expected it to be, and the performance putting people in an uncomfortable place.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Okay.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> But yeah, also there are a lot of people in the WordPress who should feel bad about, you know ...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Well I mean, to be fair, there's a lot of communities that have a lot of work to do. Ours included, so.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> That's right. And we're trying to do that. And you should listen to two episodes ago to learn all about that. And attend WPCampus 2019 in Portland, Oregon from July 25th to 27th to ...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> You're really, you're doing a bang-up job. Yes, where we will be talking about how we are continuing our strategies of diversity inclusion, including adding some mentorship opportunities.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> And if you come to the conference, we're going to work what I'm calling a buddy system. So you can have a friend at the conference and hopefully they will help you feel comfortable and meet other people and do some networking while you're there. And you know, you can sort of take that relationship back home with you. So hey, we're just throwing all kinds of hits in here.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> I'm guessing if you're looking for a buddy, you should try to find a buddy who's not somebody you already work with. That's the idea.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, I mean you can't be my buddy, Brian.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> So I'm going to have to like talk to people and make friends?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, you know, that's actually not my strong suit either. So yeah, I sympathize with all of the self-labeled introverts out there. Even though I'm loud on this microphone in a lonely office, it's not really my jam to go out there and talk to everybody.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> So yeah, hopefully the buddy system will be something that can sort of help people, and serve as kind of a gateway to meeting others that they wouldn't otherwise meet, and do some networking. And again, take some of those relationships home with them, so they have people they can talk to on Slack, so yeah.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> I think that should be a conversation we have at some point, by the way, in a future podcast, is how we use Slack, and how ... Because it's such an important part of our community. It's like where we are 362 days of the year or whatever.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Right.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> So yeah.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> No, I think that's true. And actually, so in Matt Mullenweg's talk at WordCamp Europe. And again, I'm basing this solely on Dave Bisset's Tweets. I think he said something about Slack being sort of a game-changer for community involvement in the WordPress project as well.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> And I think, I mean you definitely see that with WPCampus' Slack too that's empowered us to have these long-running, ongoing conversations about anything and everything.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, I've heard some people trash talking Slack with their DPO, Direct Public Offering from last week or whatever. And some people were like, \"All I ever is put silly emojis on there.\" And I'm like, \"Well okay, you're not using Slack. But for the people who are using Slack, this is a really helpful tool.\"\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> So yeah, maybe someday we'll put out a session about that. By the way, we're not getting paid by Slack. We should say that about a lot of things that we're talking about [crosstalk].\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Yeah, and if the WPCampus community someday move to, I don't know, Google Meet, Hangout thing, whatever that is. The Google anti-Slack.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Google won't be paying us either.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> No.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> I was going to throw out there the, and this is a little bit old at this point, but Yoast and Google folks are working to add XML sitemaps to WordPress Core. Did you hear about that?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> I did. And that's, I think ... I mean I think in higher ed world, we have a lot of advantages with our .edu domains when it comes to SEO. But I mean, so you and I, we work for NC State University, and there's only one NC State University. But there are lots of, something College. There's some very common names for colleges that have instances in multiple states and multiple countries.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> And I feel like any little bit of SEO help that you can get there, I mean that can be a game changer for your small liberal arts college or something like that. So I think seeing that sort of thing move into Core would be a big deal.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> It's not something that helps us specifically, but yeah, I think it's a good best practice. And it's arguably fairly easy to do. So I think it would be a really nice thing to release.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> I certainly see it rolling it up into, what did they add with the last version? The Site Health tools. Which I'm really not sure how I feel about Site Health either.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Because there is some stuff in there that's pretty ... It varies, depending on your environment. We get dinged for some stuff that is, I think, very unfair.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Well I think, I mean, there are best practices and then there are things that you can reasonably accommodate with your hosting infrastructure.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Right, and because we have our own custom sort of hosting infrastructure, if we have users who make their way to Site Health and see that, and it's going to be kind of misleading in terms of how our environment's built.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, so there's some stuff I guess I feel like, the XML stuff I certainly like better than some of the Site Health work. I'm glad to see them continuing to try to improve what WordPress Core offers. But I do also worry about things getting a little heavy. Like do I need all of this in WordPress Core? Is anybody asking my opinion? No.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> This has been our new segment, Visceral Reactions to New WordPress Features with Jen.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Right, right. Well it's not like I'm enraged about it. I'm just, hey, let's talk about it a little bit.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> So what else is happening in WordPress world?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> I did want to say that Post Status. So I do not subscribe to Post Status. So again, this is not an endorsement of anything. Nobody needs to go out and buy anything.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> But if you're not aware, Post Status, well it looks to be a pretty cool site that you can subscribe to to get lots of information about the WordPress community at large.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> And they have an event. Typically this is limited to only their members. But it's going to be their publish online, streaming event is going to be available to anyone who wants to go. This is July 8th and 9th. So like a week and a half or so.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> So lots of good people in there, including our very own Rachel Cherry. So there's, I don't know if I'm going to have time to tune in for it, but it definitely looks interesting. And I always like some access to free insights, so.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> But if you're thinking about going to a conference, you should really consider WPCampus 2019 in Portland, Oregon, July 25th to the 27th. So is there anything else we should say about the conference before we wrap things up?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Do we have ... This is something we should have talked about off mic. Do we know what our social events are? Do you want to start talking [crosstalk]?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> I mean, tentatively we know what our social events are. We will be at a local bar, slash restaurant the first night. The second night it looks like we're going to be at Oak Park, which is an amusement park not too far away from our venue at Lewis &amp; Clark College. So you can come out and ride the rides and play [crosstalk].\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Play mini-golf.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah mini-golf, and they have roller skating. So I think that's going to be a pretty nice evening. We're still kind of nailing down what we're going to do on the Saturday night.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> So none of this is up on the website yet, but I would tune in at some point in the next week or so, and hopefully we'll have some updates on this.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> This is just the extra value you get from listening to the WPCampus Podcast, is a sneak peek.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> That's right.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Sneak peek of things that are not public data yet.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Because everybody was like super anxious to find out. Come back in two weeks, maybe I'll give you a list of the beer menu.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Actually, you should tune in in two weeks because we will be talking to one of our WPCampus sponsors, Pantheon will be on with me. And Brian will be on vacation.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> I will.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> [crosstalk] that he is. So I will also say that if you are tuning in and you have specific questions for Pantheon or if there's anything else that you want ask of us, please feel free to either DM us on Slack, NCSUMarit and, Brian, what are you on Slack?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> BrianDeConinck, all one word.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Brian DeConinck. And then you can also hit us up on Twitter. Still NCSUMarit on Twitter. And I think Brian's still BrianDeConinck.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Yes, @BrianDeConinck.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> All you have to do is spell his name right and you have instant access.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> All Brian all the time, if you know where that second silent N goes.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, you should change your Twitter name to all Brian all the time.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> I don't think I'm going to do that. The only other thing I'll add about the conference is that we are still looking for volunteers. And volunteering is a fun thing to do.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> And the more people we have volunteering, the more fun it will be. And the less it will be me and Maryann asking you, \"Please do this one other thing,\" because we don't have anybody else to do it.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> So tell all your friends and you should also volunteer. I know I'm really selling it. You'll get a special VIP gift, and our undying love and affection for putting the time and energy and care that you have into the WPCampus community.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> [crosstalk] ...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> So if you're interested in that ...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> I'm not going to give away the VIP gift, but it is sweet. Yeah.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Yeah, it's a pretty good VIP gift. I mean, as everybody listening probably knows, WPCampus has really solid swag all around every year.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, got to pat Rachel on the back for that.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> So if you want in on the solid VIP gift swag, go to 2019.dev5290.wpcampus.org/volunteers and fill out the form and make me happy. Or you know, don't do it to make me happy. Do it just because, give back to the community.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> I have [crosstalk] ...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> I don't care, ruin your life, go ahead, do whatever you want to do.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Things make him happy. Okay. The only other thing, I completely forgot to mention. So the other big news is Flywheel and WP Engine are merging. So what were your thoughts on that one?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> I don't know, I think, I mean it's sort of two big presences in the WordPress community. And I know two companies that people in the WPCampus world both have ... A lot of people have experience with both of them. I mean, I use Local by Flywheel. I know that WP Engine just came out with a dev kit.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> [crosstalk] specifically engine [inaudible] so I don't know if that was the foreshadowing of events, or if that was some other, more subtle thing that just made its way to be more impactful 24 hours later. But yeah, I noticed that too.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> So yeah, I mean I think, I don't know. There are a lot of big companies that are important in the WordPress ecosystem, even beyond Automattic, which I feel like everybody sort of gravitates to as the big fish in WordPress world.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> It's interesting to see this kind of consolidation. And for folks in higher ed who are using the tools that they build, I'm really interested to see how they change and what comes next.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, and [inaudible] for some of the smaller companies or smaller organizations. And then yeah, I kind of expect that we're going to see a lot of local flavor, Local by Flywheel flavor in whatever the dev kit UI winds up being. Because I think they said they're working on that.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> So I mean, I think it's a good partnership. Again, we're not getting paid by either company. But we do use Local.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> But if any of those companies want to sponsor WPCampus 2019, I think we're still taking sponsors.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> We are still taking sponsors. And actually, I'd be happy to take a sponsor for the podcast too, so.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> I don't know if we have permission to do that. But if you want to just send cash to me and Jen personally, I think ...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Again, DMing us would be a good way to start.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Well that's all the stuff I have to recap today. I'm going to give the conference URL one more time: 2019.dev5290.wpcampus.org.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> As of today-ish, plus or minus a day or two, when we're recording, we are one month away from the conference.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> That's right. That's the big news. Everybody panic. I mean us, just us, we panic. You guys, you're cool. Go ahead and sign up.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Well if you're a speaker, maybe start working on your slides or something. You know.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yes. And actually I will mention, I think registration is going to get shut at least two to three weeks before the conference. So I think you have another week or so to sign up. So if you are interested, please, the schedule is up. Go and register and get yourself signed up for some of the excellent workshops we have.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Morten Rand-Henrikson is going to be there talking about WP Rig. I mean, the other workshops are excellent too. There's an accessibility workshop and a multi-site workshop.

Okay, welcome to the WPCampus podcast, podcast for those who use WordPress in higher education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                00:30          We have a guest!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brian:              00:33          Yay! We have a guest. We have ... And not only do we have a guest, we have a conference coming up this summer. And our guest is going to talk to us about that conference and the sessions in the conference. So hello guest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               00:47          Well hello, everyone!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                00:49          Hi, Eric! All right. So I'm going to sort of introduce our guest a little bit for the folks at home. Eric can you please tell us your name.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               01:00          Yes, my name is Eric Sembrat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                01:02          And where do you work?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               01:04          I currently work at the Georgia Institute of Technology in sunny and warm Atlanta, Georgia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                01:09          Well you really sold it. What is your official job title?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               01:13          So technically my job title in a very higher ed academic sense is I am an App Developer Lead. However, what that actually means for day-to-day duties, I serve as a content ... or a subject matter expert for our web developers within the largest college here at Georgia Tech, the College of Engineering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                01:35          Cool. Do you like it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               01:38          I love it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                01:38          Okay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               01:39          It's a great opportunity to meet with web developers and web contacts from a wide majority of job titles, professions, expertise, competencies, and to help all of us together in building the digital presence that our institution works with. And moving it forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                01:57          That sounds very professional. Tell me, where did you get your degree and what was it in?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               02:03          So, I'm currently working on my third degree. So in true higher ed academic sense I love myself some higher education. This is where I'm hugging the academic realm here. I received my undergraduate degree in a bachelor's, a computer science, from Georgia Tech, oddly enough. So I went here, went out to the work world and decided to come back here I liked it so much. I then completed my master's in information systems from Kennesaw State University. It's a university in the northwest metro Atlanta area. I'm currently working on my doctoral degree at Georgia State University in the heart of Atlanta, Georgia in the College of Education in a program called Learning Technologies where I am focused research on the pairing of software development and instructional design. So how you take learning goals and translate them into software that we use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                03:09          Well, congratulations. When will you be done with that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               03:14          Hopefully December 2019 is my expectation for finishing. It's been a long and tiring journey, but it's ... The PhD experience teaches you a lot both about yourself, your limits, and the folks you're working with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                03:30          Yep.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               03:30          And as part of that I've learned a heck of a lot and I am truly excited to get passed that finish line very soon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brian:              03:39          The PhD experience also teaches the people around you in your life that you don't have time for any of their problems. You need to focus on your research and leave them alone for a little while.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                03:49          Spoken like a very well adjusted husband of a PhD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brian:              03:53          Yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               03:55          I was going to say my wife would think otherwise. So ... And she sees me [inaudible 00:04:00] like, \"Back up. [inaudible 00:04:01].\" You know it can be a lot, but it's also very rewarding and I think it has a lot of application here in the higher ed world for web development. And allows us to get outside of our pocket and explore other areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                04:14          Definitely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brian:              04:14          No, it sounds like a really cool area of research. Really cool degree.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                04:18          So, Dr. Eric, one final question, who would win in a mascot? Your college ... Who would win in a fight? Your college mascot or Wapuu. And I will let you pick which college mascot is going to go up against Wapuu, which probably puts the odds in your favor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               04:34          I was about to say, yeah we've got two mascots when you look at Georgia Tech. You've got the Ramblin' Wreck, the actual vehicle of Georgia Tech, the Model-T Ford. Which against a Wapuu has no chance. But you also have Buzz, our wonderful yellow jacket. And you know yellow jackets and similar insects can be quite annoying and a bothersome pest to deal with. So I would say they'd both have advantages to a poor Wapuu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                05:07          Yeah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brian:              05:08          We also don't know if Wapuu has any allergies, you know. There's a lot of unknowns related to the Buzz yellow jacket.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                05:15          True. It could get serious quickly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               05:18          There's a lot of variables to take into account there. But it doesn't bode well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                05:22          Nope. I mean so far Wapuu is like 0 for 2 so I'm a little concerned about him. We might have to work on this. All right, so talk to us a little bit about generally speaking the kinds of things that we might expect to see at this year's WPCampus conference. Because you are of course one of the co-chairs and we have to do a quick mention to Dash, who is your co-chair for the program this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               05:48          Yes. Dash and I have put together a fantastic program and selected a wide array of amazing sessions that represent the wide variety and expertise areas to which our attendees and our community lives in. I'm very thrilled to see the session list containing a mixture of being human oriented sessions, or sessions that focus on sort of the more humanistic part of our day-to-day work. For everyone that works in web development, you know at the end of the day we work on computers, but we also interface and work with our peers and our communities and our coworkers around us. And having those sessions allows us to look outside of our technical bubble and build those interpersonal, teamwork, and collaborative working environments and competencies that help us to create the next thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               06:46          Beyond that we have some really fun technical sessions. One of the workshops that I personally am looking forward is WP Rig 2.0. I come from a background of working with the Drupal content management system, which is a lot more geared towards more framework driven themes where you basically sub theme off of a particular theme. And this is where WP Rig 2.0 is very interesting to me because at the end of the day I think in higher education, having the ability to reuse a lot of accessibility, usability, all those standards baked into a theme and just develop our campus branding and a digital identity off of that is super awesome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               07:34          In addition, what I love about the technical part of this year's WPCampus is how we're looking forward. A lot of our technical talks are focusing on sort of the up and coming issues that we're seeing both within the WordPress environment, as well as the wider web community as we look to 2019 and 2020. Dash is speaking about PHP 7 and some of the changes that pop up there. We're looking at things like Composer and the sort of continuous workflow that comes with that and how to take advantage of that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               08:09          For higher education a lot of us have sat back and watched what the web development community at large has done with the sort of seismic shifts we've seen over the last five years or so. And now that it's reached I would say sort of a slow down a little bit and standardized a little bit, we have a great opportunity to take those lessons learned and apply them in a meaningful and strategic way to our institution. Because we're not just one website. I think we all wish sometimes that was the case. We're not five websites. We're not 10 websites. We're hundreds of websites. And so a lot of-</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                08:49          Or more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               08:49          Yeah. Thousands of websites even. So having all this knowledge here to scale from not just the top level of your website, just not the default webpage that gets thousands and millions of hits, but the individual smaller websites that we may have non-technical folks managing or creating. And so some of our sessions touch on that from working with multi-user WordPress environments to the accessibility when we're creating content or creating websites. And all the things in between. It's super exciting and I think there's a lot of value and a lot of variation where no matter where you're situated within web development and higher education there's a slew of sessions that will speak to build up your expertise and your competencies in new and existing areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                09:45          Yeah I know I saw sessions coming in as one of the co-chairs, I mean every one was looking like something I was definitely going to want to check out. I haven't looked at the final schedule yet to sort of figure out where I'm going to wind up, but for sure there's a lot of interesting stuff. Among other things, for me, yes I'm very excited about the WP Rig and Mort Rand-Hendriksen being there. We're big fans of his. So I think some autographs might have to be found.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                10:13          But aside from the starry-eyed obsessions there, I think one of things that is really interesting that we're trying out this year and has some potential is the group discussion. Can you talk a little bit about how we're hoping that's going to work out?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               10:28          So one of the things that I love about this experiment that we're going with is that we're empowering our attendees to perhaps look at something that may not be a full session, or something that may be an idea and be able to apply it to a group conversation to bring in other subject matter experts and attendees to sort of crowdsource a solution ideas conversation. So as part of WPCampus this year, we're focusing at registration to have attendees be able to volunteer or list areas of expertise that they would like to sort of crowdsource discussion around and we've allotted a time slot for those discussions to take place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               11:14          I love this kind of session idea. I've tried to incorporate it or leverage it in the events that I've worked with in the past. And I feel like the advantages and value of that are that it sort of force ... not forces, facilitates collaboration and a lot of the ... brings in a lot of the expertise and experiences we have from all of our campuses and all of the projects that we're working with day to day and gives us an outlet to be able to showcase and explain our successes, our failures, our challenges and be able to build some consensus or at least direction from those shared experiences for someone that may be, or a group of institutions, or a group of attendees, that may be hitting roadblocks or encountering an issue that they can't solve by themselves. As we-</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                12:09          Yeah-</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               12:09          Go ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                12:10          Sorry, I was just going to say it feels to me almost like a discussion that you would find in Slack, except for we get to have it in person. It's nice that we have that extra space to do that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               12:20          Yeah. And it's amazing I think what kind of actual discussions and work can happen in person versus something virtual. It's kind of like when you go to national conferences and they have code sprints. The amount of work that happens there in person when you have someone mentoring someone new versus the same, a similar level of mentoring that you would do on a Slack channel. There's no comparison. So having that opportunity of face-to-face discussions and passing on and distributing that knowledge out I think is super, super important. And especially to facilitate the knowledge sharing here in higher education where some of our institutions may be blessed with tons of web developers, while others may be a web shop of one or two that are just struggling to get by. And so being able to facilitate those discussions, make those connections, and learn from one another is just a great opportunity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               13:18          And it also empowers our attendees to get involved and to sort of place themselves within the sessions, not as a singular speaker, but as a participant. It's super exciting to see.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                13:32          Yeah. And then they can take those things home with them too, right? Like those relationships that they've formed, those conversations that they have, the ideas that they were able to come up with. And then as they're trying to realize them back at home they also know that they can use the Slack environment to sort of touch base and keep people up to date and share ideas and get help. Which, I mean we have an amazing community that, you know, for three hundred and what, sixty-two days of the year we're all off by ourselves. But it is nice to be able to take these couple of days and really make, forge those connections and then take that back with you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               14:08          That's one of the super awesome things about the tight coupling in WPCampus between the in-person conference, the online conference, and all the other days in between where we have Slack as the primary method of communication. For those exact scenarios. If I have a question about what you all are doing, for example, Jen and Brian, if I want to reach out to both of you there's a perfect method where I don't have to wait until July if I have a question where you all can provide me an easy answer. However, if there's a giant topic that I want to talk about where you all as an institution has succeeded as something and I want to learn more, that's where the in-person conference is great because I can corner you all in one of the session rooms and beg for your expertise and beg for your guidance on a particular topic that you all have excelled at. And be able to learn from you all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                15:00          And we can say no, not until you buy us a drink. I don't understand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               15:04          Pretty much.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                15:05          Yeah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               15:06          So that's a great opportunity and I think you don't see that a lot in other higher ed communities and I'm super glad that it's flourishing and we're having additional opportunities to strengthen those interpersonal relationships within our community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                15:23          Yeah for sure. Brian, I think you have a pitch to give about volunteering?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brian:              15:31          Yeah. You should volunteer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                15:34          For those of you who are coming to the conference, the rest of you who are staying home volunteering probably won't help us that much this time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brian:              15:39          But if you really want to volunteer, coming to the conference is a great first step. So that's my pitch is if you have not registered yet, check the box that says, \"I am interested in volunteering.\" If you've already registered and you changed your mind and now you do want to volunteer, even though you didn't check the box, go to 2019.WPCampus.org/volunteers and you get to hang out with some great people who will teach you how to set up the livestream and kick it off and moderate questions and do all the stuff that you always wanted to learn how to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                16:19          That was an excellent pitch. I'm totally sold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               16:21          Oh, can I join in on that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brian:              16:24          Absolutely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               16:25          I'd like to just chime in and say that my first experience with the WPCampus community was actually volunteering for the online conference when we kickstarted it. So that was really my first experience with you all and some of the session selection and conference organizing community. It's a great way to give back to the larger communities to which we exist in. And it's a great way to make new ... to network and make new connections. It's a great way to see what your peers are doing, to learn from them, and to sort of pass on your knowledge as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               16:59          And plus, you get to learn about cool new things. I didn't realize anything about conference organizing before I started here. The volunteer work has given me a lot of insight into how we make these things happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                17:12          That is the perfect pitch. Eric, you basically made this a gateway drug to ... First step volunteering, second step co-chair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brian:              17:21          I don't know that gateway drug is the term that is officially sanctioned by WPCampus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                17:27          We'll pass it by Rachel for next time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               17:29          Yeah, we need to put it on a shirt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brian:              17:33          Yeah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                17:33          Eric, thank you so much for being with us today. I, for one, am very excited to see you again coming up next month in Portland. I can't believe it's only about six weeks away. That's kind of nuts. So if you haven't already registered, it's not too late. The schedule's up. Go check online, WPCampus ... 2019.WPCampus.org/schedule will get you straight to the schedule. And while you're there you can go ahead and register and volunteer and do all the things that you need to do.

What is it now?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                18:18          Meh.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBrian:              18:19          Magic Apple podcast thingy. Or through Google Play. Or through our website, WPCampus.org/podcast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                18:29          Now with transcripts and captioning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brian:              18:30          Transcripts and captioning on every episode. And if you are looking for a way to give us feedback or send us hate mail or maybe even say that you liked something that we said, which as usual is probably what our guest said and not what we said, then you can tweet @wpcampusorg, or at Jen or I directly. Jen is @ncsumarit. I am @BrianDeConinck. And, Eric, where can people find you on the internet?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               19:01          The easiest way to find me is going to my website, W-E-B-B-E-H.com. That's got all the social media links and it's the best way to contact me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                19:12          Cool. Now I'm going to go browse Eric on the web. Thank you again, Eric, for being with us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               19:17          Thanks you all</p>","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"e3b4720f-aaa2-5e57-84d4-d6734cd5b5c5","wordpress_id":237,"count":10,"name":"Conference","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/conference/"}]}}]},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"siteName":"WPCampus: Where WordPress meets higher education"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"e3b4720f-aaa2-5e57-84d4-d6734cd5b5c5","crumbs":{"crumb":{"path":"/podcast/categories/conference","text":"Conference"},"parent_element":{"crumb":{"path":"/podcast/categories/","text":"Categories"},"parent_element":{"crumb":{"path":"/podcast/","text":"Podcast"}}}},"category":{"id":"e3b4720f-aaa2-5e57-84d4-d6734cd5b5c5","name":"Conference","slug":"conference","description":"","path":"/podcast/categories/conference"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2186475492"]}
