We're recording.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>  It says I have to give you my consent. This is new.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  Nice. Do you consent?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>  I've given you my consent. Are we actually recording now?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  Yeah.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>  Yes\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  I mean, as far as I know, we're...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>  Welcome to the WPCampus podcast. Welcome to the WPCampus podcast, the podcast for those who use WordPress in higher education.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  We are experts in our field. That is not podcasting.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>  No, podcasting, we're not experts at all. This is the WPCampus podcast. I think that's the third time I've said that, and this is our first episode after WPCampus 2019, and we're all still a little sleepy.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  Yeah. Okay. That's true. Yes. I mean there's no reason for it. It's been like a week and a half, but thank you.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  The fog is beginning to clear.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>  That's right.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  Hey, that's Maryann, everybody. Maryann is our guest this week. Welcome. Maryann Reissig. Did I say that right?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  Mm-hmm(affirmative).\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  Yes! Some of you who are avid listeners and have excellent memories, might remember that I referenced Maryann once before and incorrectly referenced her institution of higher education where she works. So, to correct this issue, we're going to ask Maryann our guest questions. Maryann, are you ready?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  I'm ready, yes.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  Cool. All right. Where do you work?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  I work at St. John Fisher College in Rochester, New York.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  Yeah. I think I said you worked at Rochester College or something.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  Oh, okay. Yeah.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  I made it up.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  Nice try.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  Thanks.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  You're good.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  What is your official job title?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  My official job title is Senior Programmer Analyst for Web Technologies.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  Ooh, that sounds good. That has a lot of big words in it.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  Yes.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  What do you actually do?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  What do I actually do? I actually do some of that. I do some web programming, web technologies, but...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  Right. I also run, I'm also admin of a bunch of other things like our SSO system and some other, borderline, are they really web applications? Yeah.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  Congratulations on your responsibilities.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  Thank you. Thank you.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           What did you get your degree in?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    I got my degree in Italian.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           I did not see that coming.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    Yeah. And actually, I had a double major in computer applications, but my first major was Italian.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           Okay. I need to hear some Italian.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    No, It's really long time ago. So my Italian is super rusty.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           I'm so disappointed.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    Okay. So my husband's favorite phrase in Italian, and it's terrible, is \"La porta è fatta di zuppa\". And it means, \"The door is made of soup.\" And it cracks everybody up when he says that. I don't know where he learned it, but he says that all the time, and it's hilarious.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           Well the door is made of soup is objectively a funny statement.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    Yep.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    And What school did you go to to get this wonderful degree?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    I went to the University of Notre Dame.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           Oh, cool. Okay. So Notre Dame is the fighting Irish?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    It is, yes.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           Excellent. We have, for our friends at home, revised our final question. Some of you might recall that in the past we have asked, \"Who would win in a fight, your college mascot or eduwapuu?\" In an effort to tone down the violence on our program, we are going to swap that for, \"Who is cuter, your college mascot or eduwapuu?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    Well, I'm pretty sure eduwapuu's going to win this one, because you know it's that little leprechaun guy.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           Well he's kind of cute.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    He is kind of cute, but he's more like, he's always in the stance, you know, so he's more fierce. So I'm going with Wapuu this time.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           Yes, he's always ready to fight.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong></p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> </strong>                         [crosstalk 00:04:06] very pointy wrists, it seems like.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    [crosstalk 00:04:10] the hand, right?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           It's probably good that we've abandoned the fight question, because I feel like the fighting Irish one is kind of like built-in answer. It's not even fun anymore.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    Right, right.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           Okay. So eduwapuu definitely cuter, that's one for Wapuu. Okay. So we should probably talk about the conference now.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    Yeah.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           I'm going to ask both of you. Brian, I'll start with you. I want to know what your favorite session or sessions were, but I'm going to start by asking what was your favorite thing about the conference?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> </strong>                         I mean, I think it's always wonderful to see all those wonderful people at WPCampus and the...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           It's just, because we're sitting right here, you don't have to...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>                         Butt even separate from the conference that from the, from the actual sessions in the conference, just talking to people who do what you do, and you don't have to explain what it is that you do, to them. I mean, that saves 15 minutes out of the conversation right there. Then you can get into the real meat of like, \"How do you solve this problem?\" \"What do you do for that?\" Things like that. This year at WPCampus was also a particular treat for me and also for Jen, because there were seven people from NC state in Portland, Oregon. I don't know why we all decided to fly across the country, but that's the most people we've had from NC state at WPCampus and some of the people...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           For any conference. I mean, except for maybe like...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    No, that's really awesome.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           Yeah.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>                        And it was an opportunity... Since we're a big school, it was an opportunity to talk to people that we just don't really interact with very often. And it's possible we might have a couple of collaborative projects come out of this, which is, It's strange and funny that it takes a conference on the other side of the country to get us talking to each other.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           Yep.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>                         But it's great that it happened.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           2,900 miles for a retreat is a little excessive.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    And those NC state people, I know you guys, but those guys, they were great. I really enjoyed hanging out with them.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           Well see, we're really cool. People should come down here more.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>                         And, if you want to be a web application developer, the people down the hall from our group are hiring right now.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           There you go. I don't know how well your job title reconfigures into web application programmer, but I think...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>                         Or if you want to relocate to Raleigh, North Carolina.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           It had some of the same words.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    Some of the same words. Right, right.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           No, I think it's the same. Yeah. All right. So Brian, quit pulling punches. What were your favorite sessions?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>                         I probably shouldn't say my session, right? My Lightning Talk. That's pretty narcissistic isn't it?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           Yes, it's a 100% narcissist. That is the definition of narcissistic.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>                         I enjoyed giving it. That was a lot of fun. Okay.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>                         What was my favorite actual actual session? There were a few sessions that I only sort of listened to through the wall from the registration desk, since I was sitting at the registration desk. But one of those was, let's see, I'm looking at the schedule right now. The Automating Your QA With Visual Regression Testing.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           I was in the room for that, so I heard more than you did and yeah, I took a lot of notes for that.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>                         There was just a very useful session for us. That's something we've been talking about wanting to do, testing. You know, one of those things that seems important. And also...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           I should say that our last podcast was actually with Steve Persch from Pantheon, talking about regression testing. So if that's of interest to you, you should go back and listen to our last podcast if you haven't already.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>                         I also, similar deal, listening through the wall, and Gabe was Mapping With Accessibility In Mind. Which he won the the best speaker, speaker for this year. So great talk all around. And then, I don't know, just a lot of really good content in other sessions that I'm not thinking to mention. Maryann, I didn't go to your talk but I'm sure it was great.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    Well thank you.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           Yeah. Yours, Maryann, is one of many that I want to go back and watch the videos for. Maryann spoke about gravity forums. Do you want to plug your session a little bit for people who want to watch it?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    Yeah, sure. I talked about automating data, getting data out of your gravity forms and how you can automate it, and how you can get the proper data format that you need by using the API. I just talked about my key study and what I've learned. But what was really cool about it, is that after the session, on Twitter, the main developer for gravity forms actually gave us a whole bunch of information on some of the questions that we had during the session. So I was like, \"That was worth it.\" Just their getting that information from from them directly, which is really cool. So there's some really fun stuff I can dive into now.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           That's great.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    And other folks too in that. There was some really good questions, and the conversation at the end of it was really good.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           That's great.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>                         That's awesome. So you fly across the country to meet up with people from your own campus, and you fly across the country to interact on Twitter with people?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    I know, right? It's so funny.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           He's off! So what other sessions did you enjoy and/or what was your favorite thing about the conference?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    Another one that I enjoyed was Robin's discussion on the UX. Just let me find it here. It's called, How Do I Wrangle This UX Thing? You guys should go check that out if you weren't in the room, when that comes out on video. It was really good. Her message was really good. I enjoyed it very much.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           I was in on Robin and and Raeann and Brian talking about accessibility. And that was a really good conversation too. I mean that was kind of a bummer because I feel like the three of you could have talked for hours, and it would've been interesting. And so I was sad that I missed Robin's other presentation, but I also enjoyed, oh Geez. The other Lightning Talk that was content related. Whose name...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>                         Oh, Donna.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           Donna, thank you. I knew it started with a D.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           Yes. Actually all three of the Lightning Talks... All four including the one with Free Geek were fantastic. The Lightning Talks were a lot of fun and that venue was great. Paul's always great to watch. He's super energetic. I think, I dunno how many slides he actually had in there, but it was like an impressive number. And for those of you who didn't make it to the conference or weren't aware, we boycotted or forgo, forgave, forgiven? We gave up some of our swag for this year in order...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>                         Boycotted sounds a little more serious.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           No, it's not.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    We had a... How about repurposed?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           We repurposed some of our money to to raise money for Free Geek and they came out and spoke to us about their digital inclusion initiatives. And so if you didn't find out about that, I encourage you to look at the website or I think you can possibly still donate. Even if you can't donate through the conference page, you can just donate to Free Geek in general. They're a great organization and you can find out more on our website at onthewebsiteatdev5290.wpcampus.org/donate I believe was the link.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    Yeah, and they're doing really fantastic work on the ground in Portland. Yeah, it's really great.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           I wish that we'd had more time to go in and a tour their venue and help out, because you can also donate your time. So if are local to Portland or that area, I encourage you to check it out. It was a great organization. And for the record, we're definitely going to be doing that again next year when we host our conference. We'll be looking for a new organization to support, in beautiful New Orleans, Louisiana. Is that how we announced these things?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    Yeah, it's great.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           It's going to be awesome.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>                         So, yeah, I do have, I think everybody has concerns about New Orleans in the summer time, in the middle of July, but just as a group in the organizing committee for 2019, I've been really pushing and I think people are receptive to having the registration package when you get your lanyard also like a stick of deodorant and maybe like a fan or something like that. Just so that we can all enjoy the content.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           Those little USB fans that you plug into your phone?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>                         Yeah, something like that.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    Yeah, yeah. That's great.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           Or just attach them to our computers and sit there. I mean, I assume there's air conditioning. I have been promised air conditioning if we stay in the dorms. Okay?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    I've been to New Orleans in June before and everywhere was air conditioned. I don't think there'll be a problem.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           Okay. Well there's lots of cool stuff to do there, so I'm really enthusiastic about that. We'll be hosted hopefully by Tulane, is what it looks like. It's not completely a hundred percent confirmed, but that looks like it'll be our host venue, so that's amazing.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    I've never been to Tulane. That'll be awesome.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           I've never been to New Orleans.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    Oh, really?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           Yeah. No, I got no idea.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    Oh.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>                         Never?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                          I mean, I'm not sure that July is the right time to start going, but you know, I still think it's a cool experience.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    I don't think you can go to New Orleans and not have a good time.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           All right. I'm going to hold you to that.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    Okay.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           Yeah. You better go and help me have a good time now.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    Okay.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>                         Maryann, how many WPCampuses have you been to?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    I've been to all of them.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>                         Have you been to all of them?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                All of them. Yeah.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                         Brian, have you been to all of them?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>                       I have also been to all of them.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                          Okay, yeah. I'm the slacker.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                  So which one did you not go to?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                         Oh, I didn't go to the first two.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                  Oh.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                        I didn't go to Sarasota or to Buffalo.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  Oh, okay.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  And I really wanted to get to Buffalo. I don't remember what happened that year, but...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>  I think I remember what happened that year, just...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  Shoot man. [inaudible 00:14:27]. But...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>  I think that year it's possible that you were on maternity leave?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  Oh yeah. Is that the year where I had a baby like four seconds before that?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  [inaudible 00:14:37] maybe.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  That was that year. That was that year.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>  That seems like something that you should remember is all I'm saying.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  That does seem like something you should remember.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  It's my child...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  Right, right?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  The arrival of my child. But forget that. Seriously. The locations have have been really interesting and it's kind of Nice. I'm glad that we made it all the way to the west coast, but I am excited to sort of be coming back central. And the conference is always so great. I hope this means that we'll be able to get some more folks out. I would love for all of my team to be there. We need more NC state people there, but it would be nice.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  Yeah, yeah. Definitely. And I think just just getting, just having that community come together like that is so beneficial. Because like Brian said, you can just sit down at a table and everybody instantly understands when you say something about your job and they're like, \"Oh yeah.\" And everybody has a story. Everybody has a good, \"Can you believe that?\" Story.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  Yeah. So you feel jazzed and excited?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  Mm-hmm(affirmative).\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  You come back to the office and you're all like, I need to do all the things.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  Yeah. Yes. Yep.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>  I think it's also, now that we have started having on campus housing with WPCampus, life in the dorms... So the residence hall at Lewis and Clark was fine. Dorm life is not glamorous, but it was a lovely building. But I think it was this weird sort of college experience throwback where it's eight or nine at night and you run into somebody and you're like, \"Oh hey, let's talk about this.\" That wouldn't happen if we were all in hotels and doing things separately and getting dinner separately. No. Is that enough to make up for sharing showers? I don't know. But I know your [inaudible 00:16:31] happens too Just being around people and having that sort of immersive experience and then not thinking about work for three days after the conference because I was just done with it.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  Right. Except for... That's the haze, right? The haze that you bring back with you where you're like, \"I have my conference hangover but then I'm also fighting it because I want to do 8 million things and then I immediately realized that like 7 million of them aren't remotely possible.\" That contributes to the haze and then it turns into a depression and that's where we are now. Is that where we are now?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  We'll come out of it eventually, I think.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  Yeah!\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  We'll come of the fog...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  You'll find the 1 million...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  Right, right.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  And you can implement and then you'll get all excited about it.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  Right, right. And I feel like came back and I was like, \"Okay, I have to find my place again. Where I left off.\" And that, you know, the interruption of work is really, was on top of the conference hangover. It was really like, \"Okay, where do I start?\" So I had to... I went back and I had to make another to do list so I can get back into where I was. It's pretty funny, though.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  Yeah. And we have our team meeting tomorrow which will no doubt include all of the things. I know Brian has at least a couple of posted notes worth of like, \"Hey, we should be doing this.\" So that...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>  I still have stuff left over from WPCampus 2016 so...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  Oh right, right. 2016. Dang, Brian. All right, well so again, 2020 we'll be in New Orleans, Louisiana. And we hope that folks will be able to join us. Brian and I will be returning to our more regularly scheduled topics in two weeks, although that's also our first week back to classes. So we'll see how quickly we get the podcast out in between people requesting a website five seconds before the first day of school.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  But otherwise, I think that's it for now. Don't forget to always check out the website, WPCampus.org for the latest news and updates. And we should have videos coming from the conference soon.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  Yep.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  What did I forget?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  If you want to get on the slack. On the WPCampus slack, if you want to volunteer for New Orleans, get on there.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  Yeah. they're not too early.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  Get involved.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>  We'd love to have...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  Fill out the form on the get involved page.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  We'd love to have your help.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  Yes.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  Thanks everybody for listening. We'll see in a couple of weeks.</p>","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"95dfb001-f6cc-50d2-912e-fd2b865d62f5","wordpress_id":214,"count":13,"name":"WPCampus 2019","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/wpcampus-2019/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"d1bb0005-dd13-5aab-8861-9140d2015a2a","wordpress_id":36072,"slug":"automated-testing-with-steve-persch","path":"/podcast/automated-testing-with-steve-persch/","author":[{"id":"84e067d1-9447-50ad-b399-c11cd4b6b08b","path":"ncsumarit","display_name":"Jen Riehle McFarland","email":"jmriehle@ncsu.edu","twitter":"ncsumarit","website":"https://design.oit.ncsu.edu/","company":"NC State University","company_position":"Web Services Coordinator","bio":"Jen is a member of the Design &amp; Web Services team in NC State's central IT unit.

This is the podcast for WordPress people in higher education. My name is Jen McFarland and I am joined today ... Brian is off on vacation in Europe no less. He's really fancy pants, so he's left me here to do all the hard work, but I've been graciously joined by Steve [Persh 00:00:27] who is with Pantheon. Pantheon is one of our doctoral [00:00:30] sponsors for this year's WPCampus conference, coming up in just a few weeks. Steve, welcome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              Hello, happy to be here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       Great. Do you want to go ahead and start by telling us a little bit about you and where people can reach you?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve: </strong>             Sure. So, Steve Perse. You can find me pretty much all over the internet as Stevector. It's a holdover from my calculus class days in high school. Steve plus Vector, that's my username on Twitter, [00:01:00] GitHub, WordPress.org, just about everywhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       I'm just going to spell that for the people who can't see. It's @S-T-E-V-E-C-T-O-R. It's a mash, a math-up of Steve and vector. Brian's going to love that pun when he gets back. We are really excited to have you, and I'm extra excited because you're one of our first guests that we get to run the questions that we have now by you. In order to help us introduce you [00:01:30] to our audience, can you start by letting us know, Steve, where do you work?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>             I work at Pantheon. We're a web ops platform for Drupal and WordPress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       Thank you. I already gave that one away, but you answered it [crosstalk 00:01:40]. What's your official job title?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              Official job title is lead developer advocate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       Which I think is a really cool job title. What do you actually do, though? What does that mean?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              What I actually do ... I like to think of my job as the fun parts of my previous jobs that used [00:02:00] to be a narrow corner of the job are now just the whole job. I come from a background of building Drupal and WordPress websites, starting as a freelancer, then working with a handful of agencies mostly out of Chicago. I now live in Minneapolis. When I was doing that job, it was basically one website at a time, \"Make the new Drupal seven site for this university. Okay. Now, make the new website for this radio property. Now, make the new website for this magazine.\" In the in-between time [00:02:30] between those billable hours, I could maybe write a blog post. I could maybe contribute some open source code. I could maybe go and speak at a conference, and socialize there with the wider open source community. Now, that's pretty much the whole job. There's that public speaking side of it. There's a lot of conference travel, writing blog posts, pretty much doing, in short, anything we can to get developers, particularly, to try out Pantheon, and then whatever's necessary to sure they're successful once [00:03:00] they're on Pantheon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       That does sound like a pretty dreamy job, I have to say.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              It is. I like it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       What did you get your degree in to get you this dreamy job?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              A theater major, of course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       [crosstalk 00:03:11].</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              What else would you do to get into this?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       [crosstalk 00:03:15].</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              Yes. I was a theater major at Northwestern university.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       Brian is also a Northwestern grad. He's going to be so mad [crosstalk 00:03:23].</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve: </strong>             Oh, great. I had an unofficial policy with myself, during [00:03:30] my junior year, to sign up for one class per quarter that I really wasn't qualified for. Northwestern is a major journalism school, and I got myself early on the waiting list for the introductory journalism major class. By the time I was a junior, I could actually take it with mostly freshmen who had been the editor of their high school paper or going to become professional journalists, and I was a pretend journalist, working at the university radio station, doing radio news and wanting to [00:04:00] have more familiarity with journalism. Then I took a class, an advanced research seminar in cognition and neuroscience, which again, I was not qualified to take, but it sounded like fun. That was a mistake. But the one that really paid off was the class in the music tech department that had on its prerequisites list, intermediate html and CSS knowledge. It didn't specify, \"You have to take this class before you take the other class.\" It just said intermediate html and CSS knowledge, which I had none of, [00:04:30] but I had spring break to teach myself. So, I did a lot of googling and learned enough, and kept going after that class, making websites for theater companies, in particular, and then all sorts of websites after that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       That is a very interesting and meandering story. That's an interesting route to get to ... How much theater are you still doing? Is this [crosstalk 00:04:57]?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              Not much these days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       No? [crosstalk 00:04:59].</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              No. After college, [00:05:00] I did a lot of improv comedy and sketch comedy, living in Chicago, and then started doing more and more web development, kind of like the opposite route of a lot of people in that community who come from a non theater background, and then get deep into improv comedy. I was done doing a ton of that in high school and in college, and then found out I could make money playing with websites. It felt like playing with Legos and that was more [00:05:30] appealing to me than being a struggling actor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       Pay better than a standup?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              Yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       That's good. We are definitely going to have to talk offline later because I did a lot of high school theater. I had to let the dream die for college, but yeah. You said you went to Northwestern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              Yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       I'm really excited to ask you this final question which is, who would win a fight, your college mascot or [Wapu 00:05:57]? Because I believe Brian already answered this, but [00:06:00] I want to know your take on this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              All right. Well, I'll waffle and give both answers, which was my first reaction when you told me this question beforehand was like, \"Obviously, a wild cat. A wild cat would defeat Wapu.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       Kill Wapu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              The question is the mascot, and the mascot is Willie the Wildcat. It's not an actual wild cat. It is Willie the Wildcat, which is a cartoon cat, more domesticated cat than wild cat. [00:06:30] Willie the Wildcat, I think would lose to Wapu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       That's interesting. Now, I'm going to have to do some googling and take a look at Willie the Wildcat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              He's not fierce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       Brian thought it was going to be ugly. He was thinking there was going to be a lot of scratching, which [crosstalk 00:06:44].</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>             Sure, could be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       All right. I'm gonna put Wapu and Willie down as one and one in the battle.</p>\r\n\r\n<strong>Steve:</strong>              All right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       So, we're going to have to get another Northwestern grad on here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              All right, sounds good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       Today, you're going to talk to us. [00:07:00] I do want to mention that you did a Drupal camp keynote for Drupal camp, Belarus about higher ed web teams, which I want to go watch later, but we're going to talk about something a little tangential to that. So, why don't you just take us away a little bit there?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              I wanted to talk a little bit more about automated testing. It was a topic I presented on at the online version of WPCampus back in January. I'll be doing a very similar presentation at High Ed Web in Milwaukee in October. [00:07:30] One of the reasons I like talking about that is because I think it can be something very tangible that teams can act on right away. The way I tried to frame the presentation for WPCampus was, \"You can do this right now. It doesn't have to be something that's always put off for the next project when circumstances might be better for automated testing.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       You made a good point beforehand, which is it always seems like, \"This is something that's going to take a lot of work to [00:08:00] set up, and we need to set aside time for it.\" And the setting aside of time, as we all know, especially for something like that, it goes to the bottom of the list and it never gets looked at.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              I think there's well-intentioned conversation around automated testing that it can be helpful. It can improve the code itself that gets written. It can give you regression protection. You can get 100% automated test coverage. That sounds good. But [00:08:30] for me, often felt like just ... Well, more than just out of reach. It felt very far out of reach. I was always waiting for the perfect client or the perfect project to come around that would let me do automated tests. In this job, I talk with a lot of web teams and I find pretty much everyone is struggling with that problem. I try to then think of ways to make it more actionable, more immediate. So, [00:09:00] there are forms of testing that kind of focus on the correctness of your code, unit tests, integration tests, system tests. Like, \"Is it behaving correctly?\" But that takes a lot of work to do. You have to write all those tests yourself. You have to define exactly what you mean by correct behavior. But there are other benefits to testing that you can get with a lot less effort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       What's step zero that you recommend for groups that want [00:09:30] to get started at this, and need that easy win kind of thing?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              Often, I'm talking with web development teams where the wider context of the conversation is a desire to do a workflow overhaul, to build up some continuous integration processes, maybe start pushing code to GitHub. I went through this myself on web teams, the transition to, \"We're going to do all of our code changes through [00:10:00] pull requests and that will be a good thing to do. All the code changes will flow through pull requests. We'll get a review on every single one. And then after the pull requests are merged, we'll have this formalized deployment pipeline.\" You end up drawing this very complex looking diagram, all these boxes flowing into one another. And yes, when the pull request is submitted, that is when the tests run great. So, I'll ask these teams, \"Do you have automated tests to run?\" At that moment when the pull request is created and they'll say no.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              [00:10:30] That becomes the big stumbling block because if it feels like, \"We have to draw all these boxes. We have to fill out all these boxes Oh, and we don't have anything to put in the automated test box.\" I think the simplest thing to put in that box is code style checking. The WordPress community, pretty much every coder community, has decided on some arbitrary coding style, line breaks, tabs versus spaces. Do you put [00:11:00] space in between the opening parentheses of a function declaration in the first parameter or do you not? So arbitrary things that like PHP doesn't care about. The server running the code doesn't care about all these things, but the people care about it a whole lot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       And it's fairly easy to check and see, \"Yes, this found my mistake.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              Yeah. The reason I recommended as the first one is because the team [00:11:30] implementing it doesn't have to decide. WordPress as a community already decided what's right and what's wrong for code styling. When the check runs and you get a green pass or a red fail, there's no argument. Either it did comply or it didn't. Other forms of testing can have false positives, false negatives. You might have to manually check a report and decide, \"Do I care about this failure? Do I not care about this failure?\" But if you decide we're going to [00:12:00] comply with WordPress coding standards, it's either yes or no.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       I would follow that up with, that's the easy one. What would you say is the most important automated testing for [crosstalk 00:12:13]?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              Right, yes. Coding styles aren't a particularly valuable test. That's also part of the reason I recommend doing them early just as a reminder that these aren't magic. Getting a green check mark doesn't tell you everything. [00:12:30] If you start with code style checks, that's a really good reminder. Like, \"This is a guarantee of almost nothing at all. We're just saving time for the team members.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       It just feels like a nice win.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              Yeah, right. It gets you a solid foothold in, \"All right. We have automated tests. They're not doing much. We can add more of them later.\" [crosstalk 00:12:49].</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       You can tell your boss that you got that out of way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              Yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       Automated testing, done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              But a more valuable test to add, one that will [00:13:00] actually be more likely to prevent a bug from going out to production is something like visual regression testing. It's something that a coworker of mine, Andrew Taylor, will be presenting on it at WPCampus later in this summer. And it's-</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       That's an excellent plug. Thank you very much.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              Oh yeah. Plug, plug, plug.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       Folks, if you're coming to WPCampus, you want to come see that visual regression testing session by Andrew. Look it up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve: </strong>             The basic idea is that, especially in the context of higher ed, [00:13:30] sometimes an institution will have more websites than it knows about. There's a website on some subdomain [crosstalk 00:13:37].</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       What?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              Yeah, there's-</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       You must be joking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              It was commissioned by a professor who's no longer-</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       Lost websites? What?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              The professor is no longer there. The developer who built it is no longer there. No one wants to take responsibility for shutting the website down, but you know it is on a now insecure version of WordPress. The thing I would do in that situation [00:14:00] is I would try to get a non live version of the website. I would hope that there's already a dev environment. Or maybe just on my local machine, try to get a dev version, apply the WordPress core update there, and then just visually check between the live site and the non live site. Is anything different? Did I break anything? It's not as robust as like a behavioral or a system check that is checking for the correctness of the website or the [00:14:30] behavior. Really, all your checking is, \"Did it change? It might be broken now, but does it-\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       Is it more broken?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              \"Is it more broken? Did anything change when we updated WordPress core?\" Because if you just blindly update WordPress core, you might get an angry email a minute later, a week later, a month later saying, \"Why did you break that website that you thought no one cares about? But I care about it and now I'm mad at you for breaking my website, [00:15:00] and not noticing that you broke my website.\" It's that friction that automated testing should help. All of these tools should be helping people communicate with one another and build up trust between them. If the tools aren't doing that, if you're just doing something like code styling checks for no particular reason, then it's not all that valuable. But if [00:15:30] you can take a time consuming part of a job, like visually checking if anything broke and you can make a machine do it faster, more accurately, then you've got more time to do your own job, and your coworkers are trusting you more because the thing they need from you is happening faster and more reliably.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       Couldn't have said it better myself. That's definitely a session I'll be checking out at WPCampus. [00:16:00] Just for a reminder for listeners, if you can't make it to the conference, we are going to be streaming these and there'll be recordings available later. So, never fear. You will have a chance to see the session and I definitely encourage you to look these up after the fact. I know there's going to be some other Pantheon folks there. Do you want to talk a little bit more? Again, you're our doctoral sponsor, so we're really excited to have you supporting us this year. I think you might also be paying for part of our Friday evening event, which thank you very much for that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              Great.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       I'll [00:16:30] drink a beer in your honor. I think you have another person coming as well, at least one other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              Well, I will have Laura Kelly from our professional services team there. I think she's speaking on a panel about Composer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       Right. We have a panel of folks talking about Composer and updates, distribution for software, which I'm really excited to see that one too. There's a lot of good talks this year, so that should be good. You mentioned going to High Ed Web. It's [00:17:00] one of our partner conferences and so I know that's coming up in October. What did you say you're talking about at High Ed Web?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              I'll be doing automated testing for EDU.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       Oh, even better. There you go. People, if you're making it to High Ed Web, you want to keep an eye out for Steve there. Well Steve, thank you so much for your time today. We really appreciate you coming and talking to us, and also your support and sponsorship. I may very well ask you to come back and talk to me more about web teams because as I mentioned ...</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              Excellent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       ... I have a real soft [00:17:30] spot for discussing how to manage web teams mostly because I'm trying to figure out how to do it. But I really, really appreciate your time. Folks, thank you for tuning into WPCampus this week. Don't forget the conference is just over two weeks away. If you are interested in attending, we're kind of at the end of registration. But if you reach out to us, we might be able to finagle you a ticket. The schedule and more information's available at 2019.WPCampus.org. Again, Pantheon [00:18:00] is our doctoral sponsor. We're delighted to have them, and we look forward to seeing, Steve, your colleagues at the conference in a couple of weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              Great. Have Fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       Thanks again.</p>","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"b8af991b-55af-5a73-8f83-a3e55d7302e0","wordpress_id":243,"count":1,"name":"Testing","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/testing/"},{"id":"95dfb001-f6cc-50d2-912e-fd2b865d62f5","wordpress_id":214,"count":13,"name":"WPCampus 2019","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/wpcampus-2019/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"ea8f56c4-dc04-5b71-a0c6-ee08430cd863","wordpress_id":35981,"slug":"summertime-news-roundup","path":"/podcast/summertime-news-roundup/","author":[{"id":"cc224cb0-f32b-5840-9d1d-c512c0de8162","path":"briandeconinck","display_name":"Brian DeConinck","email":"bpdeconi@ncsu.edu","twitter":"BrianDeConinck","website":"http://www.briandeconinck.com/","company":"NC State University","company_position":"Front-End Designer & Developer","bio":"I build custom themes and plugins for NC State University's Office of Information Technology, and I help maintain campus WordPress environments and advise clients on content best practices.

A podcast for those who use WordPress in higher education. My name is Brian DeConinck, and I'm joined by Jen McFarland.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> [crosstalk] podcast recording expert.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Jen says she's not feeling funny today, so she didn't sing any theme music for us.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Well also I have a new mic. It's really fancy. I don't want you guys to actually be able to hear the quality of my voice. So I'm going to hold off on the singing for a little while.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> We are at some point going to try to really reach epic professionalism standards by buying or using some free, with-attribution music to start these sessions off. That's going to happen.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> So if you are a longtime listener, of which there might be one, possibly two of you.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Our moms.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> You know that the last couple of episodes have been a little shorter, a little looser. And that's a deliberate choice on our part.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> This episode is going to be even less structured, because we don't have a guest and we didn't really decide what we're going to talk about.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, you guys are along for a ride.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> So this is sort of a pre-conference summertime fun-time catch up on everything happening in the WordPress world, slash fill time until two weeks from now when we actually have a guest.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah. If you guys aren't listening to this at the pool, you should be, because this is summertime fun-time.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> It is summertime fun-time. Is today the first day of summer, this day that we're recording it? Something like that?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> I thought it was like the 22nd.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Let's just pretend it's whatever day [crosstalk].\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, whatever day you're listening to it today is summer.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> So what's new in the your life, slash WordPress world, Jen?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Probably the big news this week, at least to start, is it was WordCamp EU last week, weekend. So we got to hear from our intrepid spirit animal Matt Mullenweg about the future course of WordPress.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> I did not actually watch his speech. We usually do that. But I confess, I lost track of time. I forgot that it was EU already. And so then all of a sudden I get my alerts and my updates and my newsletters and I'm like, \"Oh dang, look at Matt's talking,\" and I missed it.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Yeah, I was busy moving across the country. But I did go back and read all of David Bisset's Tweets during [crosstalk].\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Okay well that's like the same thing, right?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Yeah it's basically the same thing as watching it live. So yeah, so ...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> I did the WPTavern recaps, so that's the same thing, right?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Yeah. So the big news to come out of that is not really anything that's big newsy. There were some demos of phase two of Gutenbergy-type things. The navigation block, navigation menu block. But there wasn't like a firm timetable. Which I guess ...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah. I was definitely looking for more information on Gutenberg phase two timeline. Because we'd like to use some of that stuff, or start to be thinking about using it.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> And my takeaway was, what I think Matt said towards the end, \"This is a process. It's going to be 10 years in the making.\" Which did not make me feel good about a release in the next couple of months, let's say.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Or I guess there will be releases, but not really feeling like those releases are going to be ... Not really knowing what's going to be in them. Yeah.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, or not feeling like they're going to be pulled into Core for a little while yet.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Right, right. But that's fun. Some cool stuff. Also fun is that there was question about accessibility during the Q&amp;A period. And we got a WPCampus accessibility audit shout-out.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Woo!\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> So now the whole world knows about us. So if you're listening to this podcast because of that shout-out, please register for the in-person even in Portland. July 25th through something?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, the 25th to the 27th. Great conversion there, Brian. I'm really impressed with your ... We should work on some marketing, some sly marketing moves [crosstalk] those.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Yeah. You know, you can learn more at 2019.dev5290.wpcampus.org.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> That's good stuff. Okay, any other takeaways from ... Oh, I thought it was interesting that, what did they say? 21 of the 24 current Democrat candidates for President are using WordPress for their election sites. So yay politics?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> I guess.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> The only big news I've heard in politics in a while.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> I guess now we need to figure out who those other three are, and ...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> [crosstalk].\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> ... either vote for them or not vote ... I don't know what action [inaudible].\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> I need an action out of here. Go and see what they're using?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Run their websites through WAVE and see if they're accessible.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, we should do that for all 24 and see what kind of damage that is.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> That's actually, I might do that.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Now Brian has something to do for the weekend. Great. Okay.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> So sort of related to our topic a few weeks ago about diversity and inclusion, but there was the WordCamp Europe after-party event that people had feelings about. I don't know if you saw all that on Twitter or not, and [inaudible].\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> No, I missed that. Please.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> There was an after-party. So during the after-party, there were performers, there were sort of cover bands. They were covering different artists and they were sort of performing as those artists. And dressed up as them and things like that.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> And apparently there was a ...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Oh no.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Apparently there was a performer who was a woman who also started taking clothes off. And that was unexpected. And the reaction of some men in the crowd was not what you would call inclusive. So conferences are hard.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, I guess. I didn't hear about any drama.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Yeah, so the WordCamp Europe people, to their credit, put out an apology about that. But I mean, I think ...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Were they apologizing for the band or the people?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> I think they were apologizing for the performance not being what they expected it to be, and the performance putting people in an uncomfortable place.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Okay.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> But yeah, also there are a lot of people in the WordPress who should feel bad about, you know ...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Well I mean, to be fair, there's a lot of communities that have a lot of work to do. Ours included, so.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> That's right. And we're trying to do that. And you should listen to two episodes ago to learn all about that. And attend WPCampus 2019 in Portland, Oregon from July 25th to 27th to ...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> You're really, you're doing a bang-up job. Yes, where we will be talking about how we are continuing our strategies of diversity inclusion, including adding some mentorship opportunities.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> And if you come to the conference, we're going to work what I'm calling a buddy system. So you can have a friend at the conference and hopefully they will help you feel comfortable and meet other people and do some networking while you're there. And you know, you can sort of take that relationship back home with you. So hey, we're just throwing all kinds of hits in here.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> I'm guessing if you're looking for a buddy, you should try to find a buddy who's not somebody you already work with. That's the idea.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, I mean you can't be my buddy, Brian.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> So I'm going to have to like talk to people and make friends?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, you know, that's actually not my strong suit either. So yeah, I sympathize with all of the self-labeled introverts out there. Even though I'm loud on this microphone in a lonely office, it's not really my jam to go out there and talk to everybody.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> So yeah, hopefully the buddy system will be something that can sort of help people, and serve as kind of a gateway to meeting others that they wouldn't otherwise meet, and do some networking. And again, take some of those relationships home with them, so they have people they can talk to on Slack, so yeah.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> I think that should be a conversation we have at some point, by the way, in a future podcast, is how we use Slack, and how ... Because it's such an important part of our community. It's like where we are 362 days of the year or whatever.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Right.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> So yeah.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> No, I think that's true. And actually, so in Matt Mullenweg's talk at WordCamp Europe. And again, I'm basing this solely on Dave Bisset's Tweets. I think he said something about Slack being sort of a game-changer for community involvement in the WordPress project as well.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> And I think, I mean you definitely see that with WPCampus' Slack too that's empowered us to have these long-running, ongoing conversations about anything and everything.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, I've heard some people trash talking Slack with their DPO, Direct Public Offering from last week or whatever. And some people were like, \"All I ever is put silly emojis on there.\" And I'm like, \"Well okay, you're not using Slack. But for the people who are using Slack, this is a really helpful tool.\"\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> So yeah, maybe someday we'll put out a session about that. By the way, we're not getting paid by Slack. We should say that about a lot of things that we're talking about [crosstalk].\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Yeah, and if the WPCampus community someday move to, I don't know, Google Meet, Hangout thing, whatever that is. The Google anti-Slack.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Google won't be paying us either.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> No.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> I was going to throw out there the, and this is a little bit old at this point, but Yoast and Google folks are working to add XML sitemaps to WordPress Core. Did you hear about that?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> I did. And that's, I think ... I mean I think in higher ed world, we have a lot of advantages with our .edu domains when it comes to SEO. But I mean, so you and I, we work for NC State University, and there's only one NC State University. But there are lots of, something College. There's some very common names for colleges that have instances in multiple states and multiple countries.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> And I feel like any little bit of SEO help that you can get there, I mean that can be a game changer for your small liberal arts college or something like that. So I think seeing that sort of thing move into Core would be a big deal.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> It's not something that helps us specifically, but yeah, I think it's a good best practice. And it's arguably fairly easy to do. So I think it would be a really nice thing to release.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> I certainly see it rolling it up into, what did they add with the last version? The Site Health tools. Which I'm really not sure how I feel about Site Health either.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Because there is some stuff in there that's pretty ... It varies, depending on your environment. We get dinged for some stuff that is, I think, very unfair.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Well I think, I mean, there are best practices and then there are things that you can reasonably accommodate with your hosting infrastructure.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Right, and because we have our own custom sort of hosting infrastructure, if we have users who make their way to Site Health and see that, and it's going to be kind of misleading in terms of how our environment's built.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, so there's some stuff I guess I feel like, the XML stuff I certainly like better than some of the Site Health work. I'm glad to see them continuing to try to improve what WordPress Core offers. But I do also worry about things getting a little heavy. Like do I need all of this in WordPress Core? Is anybody asking my opinion? No.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> This has been our new segment, Visceral Reactions to New WordPress Features with Jen.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Right, right. Well it's not like I'm enraged about it. I'm just, hey, let's talk about it a little bit.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> So what else is happening in WordPress world?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> I did want to say that Post Status. So I do not subscribe to Post Status. So again, this is not an endorsement of anything. Nobody needs to go out and buy anything.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> But if you're not aware, Post Status, well it looks to be a pretty cool site that you can subscribe to to get lots of information about the WordPress community at large.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> And they have an event. Typically this is limited to only their members. But it's going to be their publish online, streaming event is going to be available to anyone who wants to go. This is July 8th and 9th. So like a week and a half or so.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> So lots of good people in there, including our very own Rachel Cherry. So there's, I don't know if I'm going to have time to tune in for it, but it definitely looks interesting. And I always like some access to free insights, so.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> But if you're thinking about going to a conference, you should really consider WPCampus 2019 in Portland, Oregon, July 25th to the 27th. So is there anything else we should say about the conference before we wrap things up?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Do we have ... This is something we should have talked about off mic. Do we know what our social events are? Do you want to start talking [crosstalk]?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> I mean, tentatively we know what our social events are. We will be at a local bar, slash restaurant the first night. The second night it looks like we're going to be at Oak Park, which is an amusement park not too far away from our venue at Lewis &amp; Clark College. So you can come out and ride the rides and play [crosstalk].\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Play mini-golf.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah mini-golf, and they have roller skating. So I think that's going to be a pretty nice evening. We're still kind of nailing down what we're going to do on the Saturday night.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> So none of this is up on the website yet, but I would tune in at some point in the next week or so, and hopefully we'll have some updates on this.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> This is just the extra value you get from listening to the WPCampus Podcast, is a sneak peek.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> That's right.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Sneak peek of things that are not public data yet.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Because everybody was like super anxious to find out. Come back in two weeks, maybe I'll give you a list of the beer menu.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Actually, you should tune in in two weeks because we will be talking to one of our WPCampus sponsors, Pantheon will be on with me. And Brian will be on vacation.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> I will.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> [crosstalk] that he is. So I will also say that if you are tuning in and you have specific questions for Pantheon or if there's anything else that you want ask of us, please feel free to either DM us on Slack, NCSUMarit and, Brian, what are you on Slack?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> BrianDeConinck, all one word.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Brian DeConinck. And then you can also hit us up on Twitter. Still NCSUMarit on Twitter. And I think Brian's still BrianDeConinck.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Yes, @BrianDeConinck.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> All you have to do is spell his name right and you have instant access.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> All Brian all the time, if you know where that second silent N goes.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, you should change your Twitter name to all Brian all the time.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> I don't think I'm going to do that. The only other thing I'll add about the conference is that we are still looking for volunteers. And volunteering is a fun thing to do.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> And the more people we have volunteering, the more fun it will be. And the less it will be me and Maryann asking you, \"Please do this one other thing,\" because we don't have anybody else to do it.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> So tell all your friends and you should also volunteer. I know I'm really selling it. You'll get a special VIP gift, and our undying love and affection for putting the time and energy and care that you have into the WPCampus community.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> [crosstalk] ...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> So if you're interested in that ...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> I'm not going to give away the VIP gift, but it is sweet. Yeah.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Yeah, it's a pretty good VIP gift. I mean, as everybody listening probably knows, WPCampus has really solid swag all around every year.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, got to pat Rachel on the back for that.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> So if you want in on the solid VIP gift swag, go to 2019.dev5290.wpcampus.org/volunteers and fill out the form and make me happy. Or you know, don't do it to make me happy. Do it just because, give back to the community.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> I have [crosstalk] ...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> I don't care, ruin your life, go ahead, do whatever you want to do.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Things make him happy. Okay. The only other thing, I completely forgot to mention. So the other big news is Flywheel and WP Engine are merging. So what were your thoughts on that one?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> I don't know, I think, I mean it's sort of two big presences in the WordPress community. And I know two companies that people in the WPCampus world both have ... A lot of people have experience with both of them. I mean, I use Local by Flywheel. I know that WP Engine just came out with a dev kit.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> [crosstalk] specifically engine [inaudible] so I don't know if that was the foreshadowing of events, or if that was some other, more subtle thing that just made its way to be more impactful 24 hours later. But yeah, I noticed that too.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> So yeah, I mean I think, I don't know. There are a lot of big companies that are important in the WordPress ecosystem, even beyond Automattic, which I feel like everybody sort of gravitates to as the big fish in WordPress world.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> It's interesting to see this kind of consolidation. And for folks in higher ed who are using the tools that they build, I'm really interested to see how they change and what comes next.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, and [inaudible] for some of the smaller companies or smaller organizations. And then yeah, I kind of expect that we're going to see a lot of local flavor, Local by Flywheel flavor in whatever the dev kit UI winds up being. Because I think they said they're working on that.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> So I mean, I think it's a good partnership. Again, we're not getting paid by either company. But we do use Local.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> But if any of those companies want to sponsor WPCampus 2019, I think we're still taking sponsors.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> We are still taking sponsors. And actually, I'd be happy to take a sponsor for the podcast too, so.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> I don't know if we have permission to do that. But if you want to just send cash to me and Jen personally, I think ...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Again, DMing us would be a good way to start.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Well that's all the stuff I have to recap today. I'm going to give the conference URL one more time: 2019.dev5290.wpcampus.org.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> As of today-ish, plus or minus a day or two, when we're recording, we are one month away from the conference.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> That's right. That's the big news. Everybody panic. I mean us, just us, we panic. You guys, you're cool. Go ahead and sign up.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Well if you're a speaker, maybe start working on your slides or something. You know.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yes. And actually I will mention, I think registration is going to get shut at least two to three weeks before the conference. So I think you have another week or so to sign up. So if you are interested, please, the schedule is up. Go and register and get yourself signed up for some of the excellent workshops we have.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Morten Rand-Henrikson is going to be there talking about WP Rig. I mean, the other workshops are excellent too. There's an accessibility workshop and a multi-site workshop. So it's all good stuff.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Really solid workshop presenters. The multi-site with Jeremy Felt and the accessibility from [inaudible]. I think all of it's going to be really great. And yeah.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> So go check that out, and we hope that we'll see you in Portland, Oregon in a month.</p>","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"e3b4720f-aaa2-5e57-84d4-d6734cd5b5c5","wordpress_id":237,"count":10,"name":"Conference","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/conference/"},{"id":"95dfb001-f6cc-50d2-912e-fd2b865d62f5","wordpress_id":214,"count":13,"name":"WPCampus 2019","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/wpcampus-2019/"}]}}]},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"siteName":"WPCampus: Where WordPress meets higher education"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"95dfb001-f6cc-50d2-912e-fd2b865d62f5","crumbs":{"crumb":{"path":"/podcast/categories/wpcampus-2019","text":"WPCampus 2019"},"parent_element":{"crumb":{"path":"/podcast/categories/","text":"Categories"},"parent_element":{"crumb":{"path":"/podcast/","text":"Podcast"}}}},"category":{"id":"95dfb001-f6cc-50d2-912e-fd2b865d62f5","name":"WPCampus 2019","slug":"wpcampus-2019","description":"","path":"/podcast/categories/wpcampus-2019"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2186475492"]}
