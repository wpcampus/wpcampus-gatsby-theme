We're recording.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>  It says I have to give you my consent. This is new.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  Nice. Do you consent?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>  I've given you my consent. Are we actually recording now?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  Yeah.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>  Yes\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  I mean, as far as I know, we're...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>  Welcome to the WPCampus podcast. Welcome to the WPCampus podcast, the podcast for those who use WordPress in higher education.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  We are experts in our field. That is not podcasting.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>  No, podcasting, we're not experts at all. This is the WPCampus podcast. I think that's the third time I've said that, and this is our first episode after WPCampus 2019, and we're all still a little sleepy.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  Yeah. Okay. That's true. Yes. I mean there's no reason for it. It's been like a week and a half, but thank you.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  The fog is beginning to clear.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>  That's right.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  Hey, that's Maryann, everybody. Maryann is our guest this week. Welcome. Maryann Reissig. Did I say that right?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  Mm-hmm(affirmative).\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  Yes! Some of you who are avid listeners and have excellent memories, might remember that I referenced Maryann once before and incorrectly referenced her institution of higher education where she works. So, to correct this issue, we're going to ask Maryann our guest questions. Maryann, are you ready?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  I'm ready, yes.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  Cool. All right. Where do you work?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  I work at St. John Fisher College in Rochester, New York.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  Yeah. I think I said you worked at Rochester College or something.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  Oh, okay. Yeah.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  I made it up.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  Nice try.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  Thanks.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  You're good.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  What is your official job title?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  My official job title is Senior Programmer Analyst for Web Technologies.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  Ooh, that sounds good. That has a lot of big words in it.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  Yes.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  What do you actually do?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  What do I actually do? I actually do some of that. I do some web programming, web technologies, but...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  Right. I also run, I'm also admin of a bunch of other things like our SSO system and some other, borderline, are they really web applications? Yeah.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  Congratulations on your responsibilities.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  Thank you. Thank you.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           What did you get your degree in?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    I got my degree in Italian.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           I did not see that coming.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    Yeah. And actually, I had a double major in computer applications, but my first major was Italian.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           Okay. I need to hear some Italian.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    No, It's really long time ago. So my Italian is super rusty.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           I'm so disappointed.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    Okay. So my husband's favorite phrase in Italian, and it's terrible, is \"La porta è fatta di zuppa\". And it means, \"The door is made of soup.\" And it cracks everybody up when he says that. I don't know where he learned it, but he says that all the time, and it's hilarious.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           Well the door is made of soup is objectively a funny statement.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    Yep.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    And What school did you go to to get this wonderful degree?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    I went to the University of Notre Dame.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           Oh, cool. Okay. So Notre Dame is the fighting Irish?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    It is, yes.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           Excellent. We have, for our friends at home, revised our final question. Some of you might recall that in the past we have asked, \"Who would win in a fight, your college mascot or eduwapuu?\" In an effort to tone down the violence on our program, we are going to swap that for, \"Who is cuter, your college mascot or eduwapuu?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    Well, I'm pretty sure eduwapuu's going to win this one, because you know it's that little leprechaun guy.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           Well he's kind of cute.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    He is kind of cute, but he's more like, he's always in the stance, you know, so he's more fierce. So I'm going with Wapuu this time.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           Yes, he's always ready to fight.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong></p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> </strong>                         [crosstalk 00:04:06] very pointy wrists, it seems like.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    [crosstalk 00:04:10] the hand, right?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           It's probably good that we've abandoned the fight question, because I feel like the fighting Irish one is kind of like built-in answer. It's not even fun anymore.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    Right, right.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           Okay. So eduwapuu definitely cuter, that's one for Wapuu. Okay. So we should probably talk about the conference now.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    Yeah.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           I'm going to ask both of you. Brian, I'll start with you. I want to know what your favorite session or sessions were, but I'm going to start by asking what was your favorite thing about the conference?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> </strong>                         I mean, I think it's always wonderful to see all those wonderful people at WPCampus and the...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           It's just, because we're sitting right here, you don't have to...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>                         Butt even separate from the conference that from the, from the actual sessions in the conference, just talking to people who do what you do, and you don't have to explain what it is that you do, to them. I mean, that saves 15 minutes out of the conversation right there. Then you can get into the real meat of like, \"How do you solve this problem?\" \"What do you do for that?\" Things like that. This year at WPCampus was also a particular treat for me and also for Jen, because there were seven people from NC state in Portland, Oregon. I don't know why we all decided to fly across the country, but that's the most people we've had from NC state at WPCampus and some of the people...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           For any conference. I mean, except for maybe like...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    No, that's really awesome.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           Yeah.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>                        And it was an opportunity... Since we're a big school, it was an opportunity to talk to people that we just don't really interact with very often. And it's possible we might have a couple of collaborative projects come out of this, which is, It's strange and funny that it takes a conference on the other side of the country to get us talking to each other.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           Yep.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>                         But it's great that it happened.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           2,900 miles for a retreat is a little excessive.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    And those NC state people, I know you guys, but those guys, they were great. I really enjoyed hanging out with them.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           Well see, we're really cool. People should come down here more.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>                         And, if you want to be a web application developer, the people down the hall from our group are hiring right now.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           There you go. I don't know how well your job title reconfigures into web application programmer, but I think...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>                         Or if you want to relocate to Raleigh, North Carolina.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           It had some of the same words.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    Some of the same words. Right, right.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           No, I think it's the same. Yeah. All right. So Brian, quit pulling punches. What were your favorite sessions?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>                         I probably shouldn't say my session, right? My Lightning Talk. That's pretty narcissistic isn't it?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           Yes, it's a 100% narcissist. That is the definition of narcissistic.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>                         I enjoyed giving it. That was a lot of fun. Okay.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>                         What was my favorite actual actual session? There were a few sessions that I only sort of listened to through the wall from the registration desk, since I was sitting at the registration desk. But one of those was, let's see, I'm looking at the schedule right now. The Automating Your QA With Visual Regression Testing.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           I was in the room for that, so I heard more than you did and yeah, I took a lot of notes for that.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>                         There was just a very useful session for us. That's something we've been talking about wanting to do, testing. You know, one of those things that seems important. And also...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           I should say that our last podcast was actually with Steve Persch from Pantheon, talking about regression testing. So if that's of interest to you, you should go back and listen to our last podcast if you haven't already.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>                         I also, similar deal, listening through the wall, and Gabe was Mapping With Accessibility In Mind. Which he won the the best speaker, speaker for this year. So great talk all around. And then, I don't know, just a lot of really good content in other sessions that I'm not thinking to mention. Maryann, I didn't go to your talk but I'm sure it was great.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    Well thank you.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           Yeah. Yours, Maryann, is one of many that I want to go back and watch the videos for. Maryann spoke about gravity forums. Do you want to plug your session a little bit for people who want to watch it?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    Yeah, sure. I talked about automating data, getting data out of your gravity forms and how you can automate it, and how you can get the proper data format that you need by using the API. I just talked about my key study and what I've learned. But what was really cool about it, is that after the session, on Twitter, the main developer for gravity forms actually gave us a whole bunch of information on some of the questions that we had during the session. So I was like, \"That was worth it.\" Just their getting that information from from them directly, which is really cool. So there's some really fun stuff I can dive into now.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           That's great.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    And other folks too in that. There was some really good questions, and the conversation at the end of it was really good.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           That's great.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>                         That's awesome. So you fly across the country to meet up with people from your own campus, and you fly across the country to interact on Twitter with people?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    I know, right? It's so funny.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           He's off! So what other sessions did you enjoy and/or what was your favorite thing about the conference?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    Another one that I enjoyed was Robin's discussion on the UX. Just let me find it here. It's called, How Do I Wrangle This UX Thing? You guys should go check that out if you weren't in the room, when that comes out on video. It was really good. Her message was really good. I enjoyed it very much.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           I was in on Robin and and Raeann and Brian talking about accessibility. And that was a really good conversation too. I mean that was kind of a bummer because I feel like the three of you could have talked for hours, and it would've been interesting. And so I was sad that I missed Robin's other presentation, but I also enjoyed, oh Geez. The other Lightning Talk that was content related. Whose name...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>                         Oh, Donna.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           Donna, thank you. I knew it started with a D.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           Yes. Actually all three of the Lightning Talks... All four including the one with Free Geek were fantastic. The Lightning Talks were a lot of fun and that venue was great. Paul's always great to watch. He's super energetic. I think, I dunno how many slides he actually had in there, but it was like an impressive number. And for those of you who didn't make it to the conference or weren't aware, we boycotted or forgo, forgave, forgiven? We gave up some of our swag for this year in order...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>                         Boycotted sounds a little more serious.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           No, it's not.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    We had a... How about repurposed?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           We repurposed some of our money to to raise money for Free Geek and they came out and spoke to us about their digital inclusion initiatives. And so if you didn't find out about that, I encourage you to look at the website or I think you can possibly still donate. Even if you can't donate through the conference page, you can just donate to Free Geek in general. They're a great organization and you can find out more on our website at onthewebsiteatdev5290.wpcampus.org/donate I believe was the link.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    Yeah, and they're doing really fantastic work on the ground in Portland. Yeah, it's really great.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           I wish that we'd had more time to go in and a tour their venue and help out, because you can also donate your time. So if are local to Portland or that area, I encourage you to check it out. It was a great organization. And for the record, we're definitely going to be doing that again next year when we host our conference. We'll be looking for a new organization to support, in beautiful New Orleans, Louisiana. Is that how we announced these things?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    Yeah, it's great.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           It's going to be awesome.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>                         So, yeah, I do have, I think everybody has concerns about New Orleans in the summer time, in the middle of July, but just as a group in the organizing committee for 2019, I've been really pushing and I think people are receptive to having the registration package when you get your lanyard also like a stick of deodorant and maybe like a fan or something like that. Just so that we can all enjoy the content.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           Those little USB fans that you plug into your phone?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>                         Yeah, something like that.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    Yeah, yeah. That's great.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           Or just attach them to our computers and sit there. I mean, I assume there's air conditioning. I have been promised air conditioning if we stay in the dorms. Okay?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    I've been to New Orleans in June before and everywhere was air conditioned. I don't think there'll be a problem.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           Okay. Well there's lots of cool stuff to do there, so I'm really enthusiastic about that. We'll be hosted hopefully by Tulane, is what it looks like. It's not completely a hundred percent confirmed, but that looks like it'll be our host venue, so that's amazing.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    I've never been to Tulane. That'll be awesome.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           I've never been to New Orleans.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    Oh, really?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           Yeah. No, I got no idea.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    Oh.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>                         Never?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                          I mean, I'm not sure that July is the right time to start going, but you know, I still think it's a cool experience.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    I don't think you can go to New Orleans and not have a good time.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           All right. I'm going to hold you to that.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    Okay.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                           Yeah. You better go and help me have a good time now.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    Okay.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>                         Maryann, how many WPCampuses have you been to?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                    I've been to all of them.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>                         Have you been to all of them?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                All of them. Yeah.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                         Brian, have you been to all of them?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>                       I have also been to all of them.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                          Okay, yeah. I'm the slacker.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                  So which one did you not go to?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                         Oh, I didn't go to the first two.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>                  Oh.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>                        I didn't go to Sarasota or to Buffalo.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  Oh, okay.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  And I really wanted to get to Buffalo. I don't remember what happened that year, but...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>  I think I remember what happened that year, just...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  Shoot man. [inaudible 00:14:27]. But...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>  I think that year it's possible that you were on maternity leave?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  Oh yeah. Is that the year where I had a baby like four seconds before that?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  [inaudible 00:14:37] maybe.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  That was that year. That was that year.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>  That seems like something that you should remember is all I'm saying.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  That does seem like something you should remember.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  It's my child...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  Right, right?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  The arrival of my child. But forget that. Seriously. The locations have have been really interesting and it's kind of Nice. I'm glad that we made it all the way to the west coast, but I am excited to sort of be coming back central. And the conference is always so great. I hope this means that we'll be able to get some more folks out. I would love for all of my team to be there. We need more NC state people there, but it would be nice.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  Yeah, yeah. Definitely. And I think just just getting, just having that community come together like that is so beneficial. Because like Brian said, you can just sit down at a table and everybody instantly understands when you say something about your job and they're like, \"Oh yeah.\" And everybody has a story. Everybody has a good, \"Can you believe that?\" Story.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  Yeah. So you feel jazzed and excited?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  Mm-hmm(affirmative).\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  You come back to the office and you're all like, I need to do all the things.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  Yeah. Yes. Yep.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>  I think it's also, now that we have started having on campus housing with WPCampus, life in the dorms... So the residence hall at Lewis and Clark was fine. Dorm life is not glamorous, but it was a lovely building. But I think it was this weird sort of college experience throwback where it's eight or nine at night and you run into somebody and you're like, \"Oh hey, let's talk about this.\" That wouldn't happen if we were all in hotels and doing things separately and getting dinner separately. No. Is that enough to make up for sharing showers? I don't know. But I know your [inaudible 00:16:31] happens too Just being around people and having that sort of immersive experience and then not thinking about work for three days after the conference because I was just done with it.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  Right. Except for... That's the haze, right? The haze that you bring back with you where you're like, \"I have my conference hangover but then I'm also fighting it because I want to do 8 million things and then I immediately realized that like 7 million of them aren't remotely possible.\" That contributes to the haze and then it turns into a depression and that's where we are now. Is that where we are now?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  We'll come out of it eventually, I think.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  Yeah!\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  We'll come of the fog...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  You'll find the 1 million...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  Right, right.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  And you can implement and then you'll get all excited about it.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  Right, right. And I feel like came back and I was like, \"Okay, I have to find my place again. Where I left off.\" And that, you know, the interruption of work is really, was on top of the conference hangover. It was really like, \"Okay, where do I start?\" So I had to... I went back and I had to make another to do list so I can get back into where I was. It's pretty funny, though.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  Yeah. And we have our team meeting tomorrow which will no doubt include all of the things. I know Brian has at least a couple of posted notes worth of like, \"Hey, we should be doing this.\" So that...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>  I still have stuff left over from WPCampus 2016 so...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  Oh right, right. 2016. Dang, Brian. All right, well so again, 2020 we'll be in New Orleans, Louisiana. And we hope that folks will be able to join us. Brian and I will be returning to our more regularly scheduled topics in two weeks, although that's also our first week back to classes. So we'll see how quickly we get the podcast out in between people requesting a website five seconds before the first day of school.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  But otherwise, I think that's it for now. Don't forget to always check out the website, WPCampus.org for the latest news and updates. And we should have videos coming from the conference soon.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  Yep.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  What did I forget?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  If you want to get on the slack. On the WPCampus slack, if you want to volunteer for New Orleans, get on there.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  Yeah. they're not too early.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  Get involved.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong>  We'd love to have...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  Fill out the form on the get involved page.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  We'd love to have your help.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Maryann:</strong>  Yes.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong>  Thanks everybody for listening. We'll see in a couple of weeks.</p>","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"95dfb001-f6cc-50d2-912e-fd2b865d62f5","wordpress_id":214,"count":13,"name":"WPCampus 2019","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/wpcampus-2019/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"d1bb0005-dd13-5aab-8861-9140d2015a2a","wordpress_id":36072,"slug":"automated-testing-with-steve-persch","path":"/podcast/automated-testing-with-steve-persch/","author":[{"id":"84e067d1-9447-50ad-b399-c11cd4b6b08b","path":"ncsumarit","display_name":"Jen Riehle McFarland","email":"jmriehle@ncsu.edu","twitter":"ncsumarit","website":"https://design.oit.ncsu.edu/","company":"NC State University","company_position":"Web Services Coordinator","bio":"Jen is a member of the Design &amp; Web Services team in NC State's central IT unit.

This is the podcast for WordPress people in higher education. My name is Jen McFarland and I am joined today ... Brian is off on vacation in Europe no less. He's really fancy pants, so he's left me here to do all the hard work, but I've been graciously joined by Steve [Persh 00:00:27] who is with Pantheon. Pantheon is one of our doctoral [00:00:30] sponsors for this year's WPCampus conference, coming up in just a few weeks. Steve, welcome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              Hello, happy to be here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       Great. Do you want to go ahead and start by telling us a little bit about you and where people can reach you?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve: </strong>             Sure. So, Steve Perse. You can find me pretty much all over the internet as Stevector. It's a holdover from my calculus class days in high school. Steve plus Vector, that's my username on Twitter, [00:01:00] GitHub, WordPress.org, just about everywhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       I'm just going to spell that for the people who can't see. It's @S-T-E-V-E-C-T-O-R. It's a mash, a math-up of Steve and vector. Brian's going to love that pun when he gets back. We are really excited to have you, and I'm extra excited because you're one of our first guests that we get to run the questions that we have now by you. In order to help us introduce you [00:01:30] to our audience, can you start by letting us know, Steve, where do you work?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>             I work at Pantheon. We're a web ops platform for Drupal and WordPress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       Thank you. I already gave that one away, but you answered it [crosstalk 00:01:40]. What's your official job title?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              Official job title is lead developer advocate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       Which I think is a really cool job title. What do you actually do, though? What does that mean?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              What I actually do ... I like to think of my job as the fun parts of my previous jobs that used [00:02:00] to be a narrow corner of the job are now just the whole job. I come from a background of building Drupal and WordPress websites, starting as a freelancer, then working with a handful of agencies mostly out of Chicago. I now live in Minneapolis. When I was doing that job, it was basically one website at a time, \"Make the new Drupal seven site for this university. Okay. Now, make the new website for this radio property. Now, make the new website for this magazine.\" In the in-between time [00:02:30] between those billable hours, I could maybe write a blog post. I could maybe contribute some open source code. I could maybe go and speak at a conference, and socialize there with the wider open source community. Now, that's pretty much the whole job. There's that public speaking side of it. There's a lot of conference travel, writing blog posts, pretty much doing, in short, anything we can to get developers, particularly, to try out Pantheon, and then whatever's necessary to sure they're successful once [00:03:00] they're on Pantheon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       That does sound like a pretty dreamy job, I have to say.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              It is. I like it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       What did you get your degree in to get you this dreamy job?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              A theater major, of course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       [crosstalk 00:03:11].</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              What else would you do to get into this?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       [crosstalk 00:03:15].</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              Yes. I was a theater major at Northwestern university.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       Brian is also a Northwestern grad. He's going to be so mad [crosstalk 00:03:23].</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve: </strong>             Oh, great. I had an unofficial policy with myself, during [00:03:30] my junior year, to sign up for one class per quarter that I really wasn't qualified for. Northwestern is a major journalism school, and I got myself early on the waiting list for the introductory journalism major class. By the time I was a junior, I could actually take it with mostly freshmen who had been the editor of their high school paper or going to become professional journalists, and I was a pretend journalist, working at the university radio station, doing radio news and wanting to [00:04:00] have more familiarity with journalism. Then I took a class, an advanced research seminar in cognition and neuroscience, which again, I was not qualified to take, but it sounded like fun. That was a mistake. But the one that really paid off was the class in the music tech department that had on its prerequisites list, intermediate html and CSS knowledge. It didn't specify, \"You have to take this class before you take the other class.\" It just said intermediate html and CSS knowledge, which I had none of, [00:04:30] but I had spring break to teach myself. So, I did a lot of googling and learned enough, and kept going after that class, making websites for theater companies, in particular, and then all sorts of websites after that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       That is a very interesting and meandering story. That's an interesting route to get to ... How much theater are you still doing? Is this [crosstalk 00:04:57]?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              Not much these days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       No? [crosstalk 00:04:59].</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              No. After college, [00:05:00] I did a lot of improv comedy and sketch comedy, living in Chicago, and then started doing more and more web development, kind of like the opposite route of a lot of people in that community who come from a non theater background, and then get deep into improv comedy. I was done doing a ton of that in high school and in college, and then found out I could make money playing with websites. It felt like playing with Legos and that was more [00:05:30] appealing to me than being a struggling actor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       Pay better than a standup?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              Yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       That's good. We are definitely going to have to talk offline later because I did a lot of high school theater. I had to let the dream die for college, but yeah. You said you went to Northwestern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              Yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       I'm really excited to ask you this final question which is, who would win a fight, your college mascot or [Wapu 00:05:57]? Because I believe Brian already answered this, but [00:06:00] I want to know your take on this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              All right. Well, I'll waffle and give both answers, which was my first reaction when you told me this question beforehand was like, \"Obviously, a wild cat. A wild cat would defeat Wapu.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       Kill Wapu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              The question is the mascot, and the mascot is Willie the Wildcat. It's not an actual wild cat. It is Willie the Wildcat, which is a cartoon cat, more domesticated cat than wild cat. [00:06:30] Willie the Wildcat, I think would lose to Wapu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       That's interesting. Now, I'm going to have to do some googling and take a look at Willie the Wildcat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              He's not fierce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       Brian thought it was going to be ugly. He was thinking there was going to be a lot of scratching, which [crosstalk 00:06:44].</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>             Sure, could be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       All right. I'm gonna put Wapu and Willie down as one and one in the battle.</p>\r\n\r\n<strong>Steve:</strong>              All right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       So, we're going to have to get another Northwestern grad on here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              All right, sounds good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       Today, you're going to talk to us. [00:07:00] I do want to mention that you did a Drupal camp keynote for Drupal camp, Belarus about higher ed web teams, which I want to go watch later, but we're going to talk about something a little tangential to that. So, why don't you just take us away a little bit there?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              I wanted to talk a little bit more about automated testing. It was a topic I presented on at the online version of WPCampus back in January. I'll be doing a very similar presentation at High Ed Web in Milwaukee in October. [00:07:30] One of the reasons I like talking about that is because I think it can be something very tangible that teams can act on right away. The way I tried to frame the presentation for WPCampus was, \"You can do this right now. It doesn't have to be something that's always put off for the next project when circumstances might be better for automated testing.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       You made a good point beforehand, which is it always seems like, \"This is something that's going to take a lot of work to [00:08:00] set up, and we need to set aside time for it.\" And the setting aside of time, as we all know, especially for something like that, it goes to the bottom of the list and it never gets looked at.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              I think there's well-intentioned conversation around automated testing that it can be helpful. It can improve the code itself that gets written. It can give you regression protection. You can get 100% automated test coverage. That sounds good. But [00:08:30] for me, often felt like just ... Well, more than just out of reach. It felt very far out of reach. I was always waiting for the perfect client or the perfect project to come around that would let me do automated tests. In this job, I talk with a lot of web teams and I find pretty much everyone is struggling with that problem. I try to then think of ways to make it more actionable, more immediate. So, [00:09:00] there are forms of testing that kind of focus on the correctness of your code, unit tests, integration tests, system tests. Like, \"Is it behaving correctly?\" But that takes a lot of work to do. You have to write all those tests yourself. You have to define exactly what you mean by correct behavior. But there are other benefits to testing that you can get with a lot less effort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       What's step zero that you recommend for groups that want [00:09:30] to get started at this, and need that easy win kind of thing?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              Often, I'm talking with web development teams where the wider context of the conversation is a desire to do a workflow overhaul, to build up some continuous integration processes, maybe start pushing code to GitHub. I went through this myself on web teams, the transition to, \"We're going to do all of our code changes through [00:10:00] pull requests and that will be a good thing to do. All the code changes will flow through pull requests. We'll get a review on every single one. And then after the pull requests are merged, we'll have this formalized deployment pipeline.\" You end up drawing this very complex looking diagram, all these boxes flowing into one another. And yes, when the pull request is submitted, that is when the tests run great. So, I'll ask these teams, \"Do you have automated tests to run?\" At that moment when the pull request is created and they'll say no.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              [00:10:30] That becomes the big stumbling block because if it feels like, \"We have to draw all these boxes. We have to fill out all these boxes Oh, and we don't have anything to put in the automated test box.\" I think the simplest thing to put in that box is code style checking. The WordPress community, pretty much every coder community, has decided on some arbitrary coding style, line breaks, tabs versus spaces. Do you put [00:11:00] space in between the opening parentheses of a function declaration in the first parameter or do you not? So arbitrary things that like PHP doesn't care about. The server running the code doesn't care about all these things, but the people care about it a whole lot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       And it's fairly easy to check and see, \"Yes, this found my mistake.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              Yeah. The reason I recommended as the first one is because the team [00:11:30] implementing it doesn't have to decide. WordPress as a community already decided what's right and what's wrong for code styling. When the check runs and you get a green pass or a red fail, there's no argument. Either it did comply or it didn't. Other forms of testing can have false positives, false negatives. You might have to manually check a report and decide, \"Do I care about this failure? Do I not care about this failure?\" But if you decide we're going to [00:12:00] comply with WordPress coding standards, it's either yes or no.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       I would follow that up with, that's the easy one. What would you say is the most important automated testing for [crosstalk 00:12:13]?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              Right, yes. Coding styles aren't a particularly valuable test. That's also part of the reason I recommend doing them early just as a reminder that these aren't magic. Getting a green check mark doesn't tell you everything. [00:12:30] If you start with code style checks, that's a really good reminder. Like, \"This is a guarantee of almost nothing at all. We're just saving time for the team members.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       It just feels like a nice win.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              Yeah, right. It gets you a solid foothold in, \"All right. We have automated tests. They're not doing much. We can add more of them later.\" [crosstalk 00:12:49].</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       You can tell your boss that you got that out of way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              Yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       Automated testing, done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              But a more valuable test to add, one that will [00:13:00] actually be more likely to prevent a bug from going out to production is something like visual regression testing. It's something that a coworker of mine, Andrew Taylor, will be presenting on it at WPCampus later in this summer. And it's-</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       That's an excellent plug. Thank you very much.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              Oh yeah. Plug, plug, plug.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       Folks, if you're coming to WPCampus, you want to come see that visual regression testing session by Andrew. Look it up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve: </strong>             The basic idea is that, especially in the context of higher ed, [00:13:30] sometimes an institution will have more websites than it knows about. There's a website on some subdomain [crosstalk 00:13:37].</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       What?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              Yeah, there's-</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       You must be joking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              It was commissioned by a professor who's no longer-</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       Lost websites? What?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              The professor is no longer there. The developer who built it is no longer there. No one wants to take responsibility for shutting the website down, but you know it is on a now insecure version of WordPress. The thing I would do in that situation [00:14:00] is I would try to get a non live version of the website. I would hope that there's already a dev environment. Or maybe just on my local machine, try to get a dev version, apply the WordPress core update there, and then just visually check between the live site and the non live site. Is anything different? Did I break anything? It's not as robust as like a behavioral or a system check that is checking for the correctness of the website or the [00:14:30] behavior. Really, all your checking is, \"Did it change? It might be broken now, but does it-\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       Is it more broken?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              \"Is it more broken? Did anything change when we updated WordPress core?\" Because if you just blindly update WordPress core, you might get an angry email a minute later, a week later, a month later saying, \"Why did you break that website that you thought no one cares about? But I care about it and now I'm mad at you for breaking my website, [00:15:00] and not noticing that you broke my website.\" It's that friction that automated testing should help. All of these tools should be helping people communicate with one another and build up trust between them. If the tools aren't doing that, if you're just doing something like code styling checks for no particular reason, then it's not all that valuable. But if [00:15:30] you can take a time consuming part of a job, like visually checking if anything broke and you can make a machine do it faster, more accurately, then you've got more time to do your own job, and your coworkers are trusting you more because the thing they need from you is happening faster and more reliably.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       Couldn't have said it better myself. That's definitely a session I'll be checking out at WPCampus. [00:16:00] Just for a reminder for listeners, if you can't make it to the conference, we are going to be streaming these and there'll be recordings available later. So, never fear. You will have a chance to see the session and I definitely encourage you to look these up after the fact. I know there's going to be some other Pantheon folks there. Do you want to talk a little bit more? Again, you're our doctoral sponsor, so we're really excited to have you supporting us this year. I think you might also be paying for part of our Friday evening event, which thank you very much for that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              Great.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       I'll [00:16:30] drink a beer in your honor. I think you have another person coming as well, at least one other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              Well, I will have Laura Kelly from our professional services team there. I think she's speaking on a panel about Composer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       Right. We have a panel of folks talking about Composer and updates, distribution for software, which I'm really excited to see that one too. There's a lot of good talks this year, so that should be good. You mentioned going to High Ed Web. It's [00:17:00] one of our partner conferences and so I know that's coming up in October. What did you say you're talking about at High Ed Web?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              I'll be doing automated testing for EDU.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       Oh, even better. There you go. People, if you're making it to High Ed Web, you want to keep an eye out for Steve there. Well Steve, thank you so much for your time today. We really appreciate you coming and talking to us, and also your support and sponsorship. I may very well ask you to come back and talk to me more about web teams because as I mentioned ...</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              Excellent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       ... I have a real soft [00:17:30] spot for discussing how to manage web teams mostly because I'm trying to figure out how to do it. But I really, really appreciate your time. Folks, thank you for tuning into WPCampus this week. Don't forget the conference is just over two weeks away. If you are interested in attending, we're kind of at the end of registration. But if you reach out to us, we might be able to finagle you a ticket. The schedule and more information's available at 2019.WPCampus.org. Again, Pantheon [00:18:00] is our doctoral sponsor. We're delighted to have them, and we look forward to seeing, Steve, your colleagues at the conference in a couple of weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve:</strong>              Great. Have Fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jen:</strong>       Thanks again.</p>","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"b8af991b-55af-5a73-8f83-a3e55d7302e0","wordpress_id":243,"count":1,"name":"Testing","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/testing/"},{"id":"95dfb001-f6cc-50d2-912e-fd2b865d62f5","wordpress_id":214,"count":13,"name":"WPCampus 2019","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/wpcampus-2019/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"ea8f56c4-dc04-5b71-a0c6-ee08430cd863","wordpress_id":35981,"slug":"summertime-news-roundup","path":"/podcast/summertime-news-roundup/","author":[{"id":"cc224cb0-f32b-5840-9d1d-c512c0de8162","path":"briandeconinck","display_name":"Brian DeConinck","email":"bpdeconi@ncsu.edu","twitter":"BrianDeConinck","website":"http://www.briandeconinck.com/","company":"NC State University","company_position":"Front-End Designer & Developer","bio":"I build custom themes and plugins for NC State University's Office of Information Technology, and I help maintain campus WordPress environments and advise clients on content best practices.

A podcast for those who use WordPress in higher education. My name is Brian DeConinck, and I'm joined by Jen McFarland.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> [crosstalk] podcast recording expert.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Jen says she's not feeling funny today, so she didn't sing any theme music for us.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Well also I have a new mic. It's really fancy. I don't want you guys to actually be able to hear the quality of my voice. So I'm going to hold off on the singing for a little while.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> We are at some point going to try to really reach epic professionalism standards by buying or using some free, with-attribution music to start these sessions off. That's going to happen.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> So if you are a longtime listener, of which there might be one, possibly two of you.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Our moms.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> You know that the last couple of episodes have been a little shorter, a little looser. And that's a deliberate choice on our part.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> This episode is going to be even less structured, because we don't have a guest and we didn't really decide what we're going to talk about.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, you guys are along for a ride.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> So this is sort of a pre-conference summertime fun-time catch up on everything happening in the WordPress world, slash fill time until two weeks from now when we actually have a guest.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah. If you guys aren't listening to this at the pool, you should be, because this is summertime fun-time.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> It is summertime fun-time. Is today the first day of summer, this day that we're recording it? Something like that?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> I thought it was like the 22nd.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Let's just pretend it's whatever day [crosstalk].\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, whatever day you're listening to it today is summer.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> So what's new in the your life, slash WordPress world, Jen?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Probably the big news this week, at least to start, is it was WordCamp EU last week, weekend. So we got to hear from our intrepid spirit animal Matt Mullenweg about the future course of WordPress.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> I did not actually watch his speech. We usually do that. But I confess, I lost track of time. I forgot that it was EU already. And so then all of a sudden I get my alerts and my updates and my newsletters and I'm like, \"Oh dang, look at Matt's talking,\" and I missed it.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Yeah, I was busy moving across the country. But I did go back and read all of David Bisset's Tweets during [crosstalk].\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Okay well that's like the same thing, right?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Yeah it's basically the same thing as watching it live. So yeah, so ...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> I did the WPTavern recaps, so that's the same thing, right?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Yeah. So the big news to come out of that is not really anything that's big newsy. There were some demos of phase two of Gutenbergy-type things. The navigation block, navigation menu block. But there wasn't like a firm timetable. Which I guess ...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah. I was definitely looking for more information on Gutenberg phase two timeline. Because we'd like to use some of that stuff, or start to be thinking about using it.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> And my takeaway was, what I think Matt said towards the end, \"This is a process. It's going to be 10 years in the making.\" Which did not make me feel good about a release in the next couple of months, let's say.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Or I guess there will be releases, but not really feeling like those releases are going to be ... Not really knowing what's going to be in them. Yeah.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, or not feeling like they're going to be pulled into Core for a little while yet.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Right, right. But that's fun. Some cool stuff. Also fun is that there was question about accessibility during the Q&amp;A period. And we got a WPCampus accessibility audit shout-out.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Woo!\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> So now the whole world knows about us. So if you're listening to this podcast because of that shout-out, please register for the in-person even in Portland. July 25th through something?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, the 25th to the 27th. Great conversion there, Brian. I'm really impressed with your ... We should work on some marketing, some sly marketing moves [crosstalk] those.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Yeah. You know, you can learn more at 2019.dev5290.wpcampus.org.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> That's good stuff. Okay, any other takeaways from ... Oh, I thought it was interesting that, what did they say? 21 of the 24 current Democrat candidates for President are using WordPress for their election sites. So yay politics?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> I guess.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> The only big news I've heard in politics in a while.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> I guess now we need to figure out who those other three are, and ...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> [crosstalk].\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> ... either vote for them or not vote ... I don't know what action [inaudible].\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> I need an action out of here. Go and see what they're using?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Run their websites through WAVE and see if they're accessible.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, we should do that for all 24 and see what kind of damage that is.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> That's actually, I might do that.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Now Brian has something to do for the weekend. Great. Okay.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> So sort of related to our topic a few weeks ago about diversity and inclusion, but there was the WordCamp Europe after-party event that people had feelings about. I don't know if you saw all that on Twitter or not, and [inaudible].\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> No, I missed that. Please.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> There was an after-party. So during the after-party, there were performers, there were sort of cover bands. They were covering different artists and they were sort of performing as those artists. And dressed up as them and things like that.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> And apparently there was a ...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Oh no.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Apparently there was a performer who was a woman who also started taking clothes off. And that was unexpected. And the reaction of some men in the crowd was not what you would call inclusive. So conferences are hard.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, I guess. I didn't hear about any drama.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Yeah, so the WordCamp Europe people, to their credit, put out an apology about that. But I mean, I think ...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Were they apologizing for the band or the people?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> I think they were apologizing for the performance not being what they expected it to be, and the performance putting people in an uncomfortable place.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Okay.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> But yeah, also there are a lot of people in the WordPress who should feel bad about, you know ...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Well I mean, to be fair, there's a lot of communities that have a lot of work to do. Ours included, so.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> That's right. And we're trying to do that. And you should listen to two episodes ago to learn all about that. And attend WPCampus 2019 in Portland, Oregon from July 25th to 27th to ...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> You're really, you're doing a bang-up job. Yes, where we will be talking about how we are continuing our strategies of diversity inclusion, including adding some mentorship opportunities.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> And if you come to the conference, we're going to work what I'm calling a buddy system. So you can have a friend at the conference and hopefully they will help you feel comfortable and meet other people and do some networking while you're there. And you know, you can sort of take that relationship back home with you. So hey, we're just throwing all kinds of hits in here.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> I'm guessing if you're looking for a buddy, you should try to find a buddy who's not somebody you already work with. That's the idea.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, I mean you can't be my buddy, Brian.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> So I'm going to have to like talk to people and make friends?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, you know, that's actually not my strong suit either. So yeah, I sympathize with all of the self-labeled introverts out there. Even though I'm loud on this microphone in a lonely office, it's not really my jam to go out there and talk to everybody.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> So yeah, hopefully the buddy system will be something that can sort of help people, and serve as kind of a gateway to meeting others that they wouldn't otherwise meet, and do some networking. And again, take some of those relationships home with them, so they have people they can talk to on Slack, so yeah.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> I think that should be a conversation we have at some point, by the way, in a future podcast, is how we use Slack, and how ... Because it's such an important part of our community. It's like where we are 362 days of the year or whatever.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Right.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> So yeah.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> No, I think that's true. And actually, so in Matt Mullenweg's talk at WordCamp Europe. And again, I'm basing this solely on Dave Bisset's Tweets. I think he said something about Slack being sort of a game-changer for community involvement in the WordPress project as well.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> And I think, I mean you definitely see that with WPCampus' Slack too that's empowered us to have these long-running, ongoing conversations about anything and everything.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, I've heard some people trash talking Slack with their DPO, Direct Public Offering from last week or whatever. And some people were like, \"All I ever is put silly emojis on there.\" And I'm like, \"Well okay, you're not using Slack. But for the people who are using Slack, this is a really helpful tool.\"\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> So yeah, maybe someday we'll put out a session about that. By the way, we're not getting paid by Slack. We should say that about a lot of things that we're talking about [crosstalk].\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Yeah, and if the WPCampus community someday move to, I don't know, Google Meet, Hangout thing, whatever that is. The Google anti-Slack.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Google won't be paying us either.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> No.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> I was going to throw out there the, and this is a little bit old at this point, but Yoast and Google folks are working to add XML sitemaps to WordPress Core. Did you hear about that?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> I did. And that's, I think ... I mean I think in higher ed world, we have a lot of advantages with our .edu domains when it comes to SEO. But I mean, so you and I, we work for NC State University, and there's only one NC State University. But there are lots of, something College. There's some very common names for colleges that have instances in multiple states and multiple countries.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> And I feel like any little bit of SEO help that you can get there, I mean that can be a game changer for your small liberal arts college or something like that. So I think seeing that sort of thing move into Core would be a big deal.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> It's not something that helps us specifically, but yeah, I think it's a good best practice. And it's arguably fairly easy to do. So I think it would be a really nice thing to release.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> I certainly see it rolling it up into, what did they add with the last version? The Site Health tools. Which I'm really not sure how I feel about Site Health either.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Because there is some stuff in there that's pretty ... It varies, depending on your environment. We get dinged for some stuff that is, I think, very unfair.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Well I think, I mean, there are best practices and then there are things that you can reasonably accommodate with your hosting infrastructure.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Right, and because we have our own custom sort of hosting infrastructure, if we have users who make their way to Site Health and see that, and it's going to be kind of misleading in terms of how our environment's built.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, so there's some stuff I guess I feel like, the XML stuff I certainly like better than some of the Site Health work. I'm glad to see them continuing to try to improve what WordPress Core offers. But I do also worry about things getting a little heavy. Like do I need all of this in WordPress Core? Is anybody asking my opinion? No.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> This has been our new segment, Visceral Reactions to New WordPress Features with Jen.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Right, right. Well it's not like I'm enraged about it. I'm just, hey, let's talk about it a little bit.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> So what else is happening in WordPress world?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> I did want to say that Post Status. So I do not subscribe to Post Status. So again, this is not an endorsement of anything. Nobody needs to go out and buy anything.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> But if you're not aware, Post Status, well it looks to be a pretty cool site that you can subscribe to to get lots of information about the WordPress community at large.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> And they have an event. Typically this is limited to only their members. But it's going to be their publish online, streaming event is going to be available to anyone who wants to go. This is July 8th and 9th. So like a week and a half or so.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> So lots of good people in there, including our very own Rachel Cherry. So there's, I don't know if I'm going to have time to tune in for it, but it definitely looks interesting. And I always like some access to free insights, so.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> But if you're thinking about going to a conference, you should really consider WPCampus 2019 in Portland, Oregon, July 25th to the 27th. So is there anything else we should say about the conference before we wrap things up?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Do we have ... This is something we should have talked about off mic. Do we know what our social events are? Do you want to start talking [crosstalk]?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> I mean, tentatively we know what our social events are. We will be at a local bar, slash restaurant the first night. The second night it looks like we're going to be at Oak Park, which is an amusement park not too far away from our venue at Lewis &amp; Clark College. So you can come out and ride the rides and play [crosstalk].\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Play mini-golf.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah mini-golf, and they have roller skating. So I think that's going to be a pretty nice evening. We're still kind of nailing down what we're going to do on the Saturday night.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> So none of this is up on the website yet, but I would tune in at some point in the next week or so, and hopefully we'll have some updates on this.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> This is just the extra value you get from listening to the WPCampus Podcast, is a sneak peek.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> That's right.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Sneak peek of things that are not public data yet.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Because everybody was like super anxious to find out. Come back in two weeks, maybe I'll give you a list of the beer menu.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Actually, you should tune in in two weeks because we will be talking to one of our WPCampus sponsors, Pantheon will be on with me. And Brian will be on vacation.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> I will.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> [crosstalk] that he is. So I will also say that if you are tuning in and you have specific questions for Pantheon or if there's anything else that you want ask of us, please feel free to either DM us on Slack, NCSUMarit and, Brian, what are you on Slack?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> BrianDeConinck, all one word.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Brian DeConinck. And then you can also hit us up on Twitter. Still NCSUMarit on Twitter. And I think Brian's still BrianDeConinck.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Yes, @BrianDeConinck.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> All you have to do is spell his name right and you have instant access.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> All Brian all the time, if you know where that second silent N goes.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, you should change your Twitter name to all Brian all the time.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> I don't think I'm going to do that. The only other thing I'll add about the conference is that we are still looking for volunteers. And volunteering is a fun thing to do.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> And the more people we have volunteering, the more fun it will be. And the less it will be me and Maryann asking you, \"Please do this one other thing,\" because we don't have anybody else to do it.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> So tell all your friends and you should also volunteer. I know I'm really selling it. You'll get a special VIP gift, and our undying love and affection for putting the time and energy and care that you have into the WPCampus community.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> [crosstalk] ...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> So if you're interested in that ...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> I'm not going to give away the VIP gift, but it is sweet. Yeah.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Yeah, it's a pretty good VIP gift. I mean, as everybody listening probably knows, WPCampus has really solid swag all around every year.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, got to pat Rachel on the back for that.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> So if you want in on the solid VIP gift swag, go to 2019.dev5290.wpcampus.org/volunteers and fill out the form and make me happy. Or you know, don't do it to make me happy. Do it just because, give back to the community.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> I have [crosstalk] ...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> I don't care, ruin your life, go ahead, do whatever you want to do.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Things make him happy. Okay. The only other thing, I completely forgot to mention. So the other big news is Flywheel and WP Engine are merging. So what were your thoughts on that one?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> I don't know, I think, I mean it's sort of two big presences in the WordPress community. And I know two companies that people in the WPCampus world both have ... A lot of people have experience with both of them. I mean, I use Local by Flywheel. I know that WP Engine just came out with a dev kit.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> [crosstalk] specifically engine [inaudible] so I don't know if that was the foreshadowing of events, or if that was some other, more subtle thing that just made its way to be more impactful 24 hours later. But yeah, I noticed that too.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> So yeah, I mean I think, I don't know. There are a lot of big companies that are important in the WordPress ecosystem, even beyond Automattic, which I feel like everybody sort of gravitates to as the big fish in WordPress world.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> It's interesting to see this kind of consolidation. And for folks in higher ed who are using the tools that they build, I'm really interested to see how they change and what comes next.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, and [inaudible] for some of the smaller companies or smaller organizations. And then yeah, I kind of expect that we're going to see a lot of local flavor, Local by Flywheel flavor in whatever the dev kit UI winds up being. Because I think they said they're working on that.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> So I mean, I think it's a good partnership. Again, we're not getting paid by either company. But we do use Local.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> But if any of those companies want to sponsor WPCampus 2019, I think we're still taking sponsors.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> We are still taking sponsors. And actually, I'd be happy to take a sponsor for the podcast too, so.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> I don't know if we have permission to do that. But if you want to just send cash to me and Jen personally, I think ...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Again, DMing us would be a good way to start.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Well that's all the stuff I have to recap today. I'm going to give the conference URL one more time: 2019.dev5290.wpcampus.org.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> As of today-ish, plus or minus a day or two, when we're recording, we are one month away from the conference.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> That's right. That's the big news. Everybody panic. I mean us, just us, we panic. You guys, you're cool. Go ahead and sign up.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Well if you're a speaker, maybe start working on your slides or something. You know.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yes. And actually I will mention, I think registration is going to get shut at least two to three weeks before the conference. So I think you have another week or so to sign up. So if you are interested, please, the schedule is up. Go and register and get yourself signed up for some of the excellent workshops we have.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Morten Rand-Henrikson is going to be there talking about WP Rig. I mean, the other workshops are excellent too. There's an accessibility workshop and a multi-site workshop. So it's all good stuff.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Really solid workshop presenters. The multi-site with Jeremy Felt and the accessibility from [inaudible]. I think all of it's going to be really great. And yeah.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> So go check that out, and we hope that we'll see you in Portland, Oregon in a month.</p>","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"e3b4720f-aaa2-5e57-84d4-d6734cd5b5c5","wordpress_id":237,"count":10,"name":"Conference","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/conference/"},{"id":"95dfb001-f6cc-50d2-912e-fd2b865d62f5","wordpress_id":214,"count":13,"name":"WPCampus 2019","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/wpcampus-2019/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"1e234b5c-c1c4-5359-a4fe-f94bc082d8b4","wordpress_id":35883,"slug":"the-schedule-for-wpcampus-2019","path":"/podcast/the-schedule-for-wpcampus-2019/","author":[{"id":"84e067d1-9447-50ad-b399-c11cd4b6b08b","path":"ncsumarit","display_name":"Jen Riehle McFarland","email":"jmriehle@ncsu.edu","twitter":"ncsumarit","website":"https://design.oit.ncsu.edu/","company":"NC State University","company_position":"Web Services Coordinator","bio":"Jen is a member of the Design &amp; Web Services team in NC State's central IT unit.

Okay, welcome to the WPCampus podcast, podcast for those who use WordPress in higher education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                00:30          We have a guest!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brian:              00:33          Yay! We have a guest. We have ... And not only do we have a guest, we have a conference coming up this summer. And our guest is going to talk to us about that conference and the sessions in the conference. So hello guest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               00:47          Well hello, everyone!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                00:49          Hi, Eric! All right. So I'm going to sort of introduce our guest a little bit for the folks at home. Eric can you please tell us your name.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               01:00          Yes, my name is Eric Sembrat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                01:02          And where do you work?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               01:04          I currently work at the Georgia Institute of Technology in sunny and warm Atlanta, Georgia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                01:09          Well you really sold it. What is your official job title?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               01:13          So technically my job title in a very higher ed academic sense is I am an App Developer Lead. However, what that actually means for day-to-day duties, I serve as a content ... or a subject matter expert for our web developers within the largest college here at Georgia Tech, the College of Engineering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                01:35          Cool. Do you like it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               01:38          I love it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                01:38          Okay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               01:39          It's a great opportunity to meet with web developers and web contacts from a wide majority of job titles, professions, expertise, competencies, and to help all of us together in building the digital presence that our institution works with. And moving it forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                01:57          That sounds very professional. Tell me, where did you get your degree and what was it in?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               02:03          So, I'm currently working on my third degree. So in true higher ed academic sense I love myself some higher education. This is where I'm hugging the academic realm here. I received my undergraduate degree in a bachelor's, a computer science, from Georgia Tech, oddly enough. So I went here, went out to the work world and decided to come back here I liked it so much. I then completed my master's in information systems from Kennesaw State University. It's a university in the northwest metro Atlanta area. I'm currently working on my doctoral degree at Georgia State University in the heart of Atlanta, Georgia in the College of Education in a program called Learning Technologies where I am focused research on the pairing of software development and instructional design. So how you take learning goals and translate them into software that we use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                03:09          Well, congratulations. When will you be done with that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               03:14          Hopefully December 2019 is my expectation for finishing. It's been a long and tiring journey, but it's ... The PhD experience teaches you a lot both about yourself, your limits, and the folks you're working with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                03:30          Yep.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               03:30          And as part of that I've learned a heck of a lot and I am truly excited to get passed that finish line very soon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brian:              03:39          The PhD experience also teaches the people around you in your life that you don't have time for any of their problems. You need to focus on your research and leave them alone for a little while.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                03:49          Spoken like a very well adjusted husband of a PhD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brian:              03:53          Yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               03:55          I was going to say my wife would think otherwise. So ... And she sees me [inaudible 00:04:00] like, \"Back up. [inaudible 00:04:01].\" You know it can be a lot, but it's also very rewarding and I think it has a lot of application here in the higher ed world for web development. And allows us to get outside of our pocket and explore other areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                04:14          Definitely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brian:              04:14          No, it sounds like a really cool area of research. Really cool degree.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                04:18          So, Dr. Eric, one final question, who would win in a mascot? Your college ... Who would win in a fight? Your college mascot or Wapuu. And I will let you pick which college mascot is going to go up against Wapuu, which probably puts the odds in your favor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               04:34          I was about to say, yeah we've got two mascots when you look at Georgia Tech. You've got the Ramblin' Wreck, the actual vehicle of Georgia Tech, the Model-T Ford. Which against a Wapuu has no chance. But you also have Buzz, our wonderful yellow jacket. And you know yellow jackets and similar insects can be quite annoying and a bothersome pest to deal with. So I would say they'd both have advantages to a poor Wapuu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                05:07          Yeah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brian:              05:08          We also don't know if Wapuu has any allergies, you know. There's a lot of unknowns related to the Buzz yellow jacket.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                05:15          True. It could get serious quickly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               05:18          There's a lot of variables to take into account there. But it doesn't bode well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                05:22          Nope. I mean so far Wapuu is like 0 for 2 so I'm a little concerned about him. We might have to work on this. All right, so talk to us a little bit about generally speaking the kinds of things that we might expect to see at this year's WPCampus conference. Because you are of course one of the co-chairs and we have to do a quick mention to Dash, who is your co-chair for the program this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               05:48          Yes. Dash and I have put together a fantastic program and selected a wide array of amazing sessions that represent the wide variety and expertise areas to which our attendees and our community lives in. I'm very thrilled to see the session list containing a mixture of being human oriented sessions, or sessions that focus on sort of the more humanistic part of our day-to-day work. For everyone that works in web development, you know at the end of the day we work on computers, but we also interface and work with our peers and our communities and our coworkers around us. And having those sessions allows us to look outside of our technical bubble and build those interpersonal, teamwork, and collaborative working environments and competencies that help us to create the next thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               06:46          Beyond that we have some really fun technical sessions. One of the workshops that I personally am looking forward is WP Rig 2.0. I come from a background of working with the Drupal content management system, which is a lot more geared towards more framework driven themes where you basically sub theme off of a particular theme. And this is where WP Rig 2.0 is very interesting to me because at the end of the day I think in higher education, having the ability to reuse a lot of accessibility, usability, all those standards baked into a theme and just develop our campus branding and a digital identity off of that is super awesome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               07:34          In addition, what I love about the technical part of this year's WPCampus is how we're looking forward. A lot of our technical talks are focusing on sort of the up and coming issues that we're seeing both within the WordPress environment, as well as the wider web community as we look to 2019 and 2020. Dash is speaking about PHP 7 and some of the changes that pop up there. We're looking at things like Composer and the sort of continuous workflow that comes with that and how to take advantage of that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               08:09          For higher education a lot of us have sat back and watched what the web development community at large has done with the sort of seismic shifts we've seen over the last five years or so. And now that it's reached I would say sort of a slow down a little bit and standardized a little bit, we have a great opportunity to take those lessons learned and apply them in a meaningful and strategic way to our institution. Because we're not just one website. I think we all wish sometimes that was the case. We're not five websites. We're not 10 websites. We're hundreds of websites. And so a lot of-</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                08:49          Or more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               08:49          Yeah. Thousands of websites even. So having all this knowledge here to scale from not just the top level of your website, just not the default webpage that gets thousands and millions of hits, but the individual smaller websites that we may have non-technical folks managing or creating. And so some of our sessions touch on that from working with multi-user WordPress environments to the accessibility when we're creating content or creating websites. And all the things in between. It's super exciting and I think there's a lot of value and a lot of variation where no matter where you're situated within web development and higher education there's a slew of sessions that will speak to build up your expertise and your competencies in new and existing areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                09:45          Yeah I know I saw sessions coming in as one of the co-chairs, I mean every one was looking like something I was definitely going to want to check out. I haven't looked at the final schedule yet to sort of figure out where I'm going to wind up, but for sure there's a lot of interesting stuff. Among other things, for me, yes I'm very excited about the WP Rig and Mort Rand-Hendriksen being there. We're big fans of his. So I think some autographs might have to be found.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                10:13          But aside from the starry-eyed obsessions there, I think one of things that is really interesting that we're trying out this year and has some potential is the group discussion. Can you talk a little bit about how we're hoping that's going to work out?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               10:28          So one of the things that I love about this experiment that we're going with is that we're empowering our attendees to perhaps look at something that may not be a full session, or something that may be an idea and be able to apply it to a group conversation to bring in other subject matter experts and attendees to sort of crowdsource a solution ideas conversation. So as part of WPCampus this year, we're focusing at registration to have attendees be able to volunteer or list areas of expertise that they would like to sort of crowdsource discussion around and we've allotted a time slot for those discussions to take place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               11:14          I love this kind of session idea. I've tried to incorporate it or leverage it in the events that I've worked with in the past. And I feel like the advantages and value of that are that it sort of force ... not forces, facilitates collaboration and a lot of the ... brings in a lot of the expertise and experiences we have from all of our campuses and all of the projects that we're working with day to day and gives us an outlet to be able to showcase and explain our successes, our failures, our challenges and be able to build some consensus or at least direction from those shared experiences for someone that may be, or a group of institutions, or a group of attendees, that may be hitting roadblocks or encountering an issue that they can't solve by themselves. As we-</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                12:09          Yeah-</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               12:09          Go ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                12:10          Sorry, I was just going to say it feels to me almost like a discussion that you would find in Slack, except for we get to have it in person. It's nice that we have that extra space to do that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               12:20          Yeah. And it's amazing I think what kind of actual discussions and work can happen in person versus something virtual. It's kind of like when you go to national conferences and they have code sprints. The amount of work that happens there in person when you have someone mentoring someone new versus the same, a similar level of mentoring that you would do on a Slack channel. There's no comparison. So having that opportunity of face-to-face discussions and passing on and distributing that knowledge out I think is super, super important. And especially to facilitate the knowledge sharing here in higher education where some of our institutions may be blessed with tons of web developers, while others may be a web shop of one or two that are just struggling to get by. And so being able to facilitate those discussions, make those connections, and learn from one another is just a great opportunity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               13:18          And it also empowers our attendees to get involved and to sort of place themselves within the sessions, not as a singular speaker, but as a participant. It's super exciting to see.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                13:32          Yeah. And then they can take those things home with them too, right? Like those relationships that they've formed, those conversations that they have, the ideas that they were able to come up with. And then as they're trying to realize them back at home they also know that they can use the Slack environment to sort of touch base and keep people up to date and share ideas and get help. Which, I mean we have an amazing community that, you know, for three hundred and what, sixty-two days of the year we're all off by ourselves. But it is nice to be able to take these couple of days and really make, forge those connections and then take that back with you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               14:08          That's one of the super awesome things about the tight coupling in WPCampus between the in-person conference, the online conference, and all the other days in between where we have Slack as the primary method of communication. For those exact scenarios. If I have a question about what you all are doing, for example, Jen and Brian, if I want to reach out to both of you there's a perfect method where I don't have to wait until July if I have a question where you all can provide me an easy answer. However, if there's a giant topic that I want to talk about where you all as an institution has succeeded as something and I want to learn more, that's where the in-person conference is great because I can corner you all in one of the session rooms and beg for your expertise and beg for your guidance on a particular topic that you all have excelled at. And be able to learn from you all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                15:00          And we can say no, not until you buy us a drink. I don't understand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               15:04          Pretty much.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                15:05          Yeah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               15:06          So that's a great opportunity and I think you don't see that a lot in other higher ed communities and I'm super glad that it's flourishing and we're having additional opportunities to strengthen those interpersonal relationships within our community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                15:23          Yeah for sure. Brian, I think you have a pitch to give about volunteering?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brian:              15:31          Yeah. You should volunteer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                15:34          For those of you who are coming to the conference, the rest of you who are staying home volunteering probably won't help us that much this time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brian:              15:39          But if you really want to volunteer, coming to the conference is a great first step. So that's my pitch is if you have not registered yet, check the box that says, \"I am interested in volunteering.\" If you've already registered and you changed your mind and now you do want to volunteer, even though you didn't check the box, go to 2019.WPCampus.org/volunteers and you get to hang out with some great people who will teach you how to set up the livestream and kick it off and moderate questions and do all the stuff that you always wanted to learn how to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                16:19          That was an excellent pitch. I'm totally sold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               16:21          Oh, can I join in on that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brian:              16:24          Absolutely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               16:25          I'd like to just chime in and say that my first experience with the WPCampus community was actually volunteering for the online conference when we kickstarted it. So that was really my first experience with you all and some of the session selection and conference organizing community. It's a great way to give back to the larger communities to which we exist in. And it's a great way to make new ... to network and make new connections. It's a great way to see what your peers are doing, to learn from them, and to sort of pass on your knowledge as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               16:59          And plus, you get to learn about cool new things. I didn't realize anything about conference organizing before I started here. The volunteer work has given me a lot of insight into how we make these things happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                17:12          That is the perfect pitch. Eric, you basically made this a gateway drug to ... First step volunteering, second step co-chair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brian:              17:21          I don't know that gateway drug is the term that is officially sanctioned by WPCampus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                17:27          We'll pass it by Rachel for next time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               17:29          Yeah, we need to put it on a shirt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brian:              17:33          Yeah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                17:33          Eric, thank you so much for being with us today. I, for one, am very excited to see you again coming up next month in Portland. I can't believe it's only about six weeks away. That's kind of nuts. So if you haven't already registered, it's not too late. The schedule's up. Go check online, WPCampus ... 2019.WPCampus.org/schedule will get you straight to the schedule. And while you're there you can go ahead and register and volunteer and do all the things that you need to do. If you're not already online there's more information on Slack, so feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                18:08          Brian, what did I forget?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brian:              18:09          Just as a reminder this podcast can be listened to via iTunes, well I guess iTunes isn't a thing anymore, is it? What is it now?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                18:18          Meh.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBrian:              18:19          Magic Apple podcast thingy. Or through Google Play. Or through our website, WPCampus.org/podcast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                18:29          Now with transcripts and captioning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brian:              18:30          Transcripts and captioning on every episode. And if you are looking for a way to give us feedback or send us hate mail or maybe even say that you liked something that we said, which as usual is probably what our guest said and not what we said, then you can tweet @wpcampusorg, or at Jen or I directly. Jen is @ncsumarit. I am @BrianDeConinck. And, Eric, where can people find you on the internet?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               19:01          The easiest way to find me is going to my website, W-E-B-B-E-H.com. That's got all the social media links and it's the best way to contact me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jen:                19:12          Cool. Now I'm going to go browse Eric on the web. Thank you again, Eric, for being with us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric:               19:17          Thanks you all</p>","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"e3b4720f-aaa2-5e57-84d4-d6734cd5b5c5","wordpress_id":237,"count":10,"name":"Conference","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/conference/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"daeb315a-d28c-59f7-a7c8-9d967b5c63de","wordpress_id":35712,"slug":"diversity-equity-inclusion","path":"/podcast/diversity-equity-inclusion/","author":[{"id":"cc224cb0-f32b-5840-9d1d-c512c0de8162","path":"briandeconinck","display_name":"Brian DeConinck","email":"bpdeconi@ncsu.edu","twitter":"BrianDeConinck","website":"http://www.briandeconinck.com/","company":"NC State University","company_position":"Front-End Designer & Developer","bio":"I build custom themes and plugins for NC State University's Office of Information Technology, and I help maintain campus WordPress environments and advise clients on content best practices.

We don't have the right to any of this music you're singing.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> I think JOHN WILLIAMS, is a cool guy. I think he'd be down, I think. He probably he probably be touched, I think. This is cool. I like WordPress, go for it.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Well JOHN WILLIAMS is a well known WordPress user\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> I don't think that's true. We probably shouldn't start that rumor.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Yeah, welcome to the WPCampus podcast. Podcast for those who use WordPress in higher education. That's us. We use us as we use WordPress and higher education.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, but tell us your name, Brian\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> My name is Brian DeConinck and I am apparently, your host. I work for North Carolina State University and I get yelled at all the time by Jen, who is my co host / guest on this episode. This is a weird episode. She's in multiple roles.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, my name is Jen McFarland, and I am both. Yeah, sort of guest voice here, but also the co host apparently I got I got the bump up from color commentary to co host. Kind of gave it to myself because I'm also Brian's boss. This is where he yells, that I'm not his supervisor. Um, so yeah. Today we're gonna be talking about diversity and inclusion, um, for those of you who might have missed it WPCampus released our diversity, equity, and inclusion statement this week.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Yay.\r\nSo yeah, so, um, let's start well. Okay, so first Jen, you are the one of the leads for the diversity and inclusion group in WPCampus, you want to talk a little bit about that the genesis of that group and sort of the backstory that brought us to today. \r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Sure. So, our group started a little over a year ago, probably actually my term as co chair should be coming up my original co chair with Sue Jenkins and she had to step back, but our good friend from oh I'm gonna screw this up, Rochester college, I believe, I'm sorry.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> I think it's a different school. Oh, gosh. Maryann. We're so sorry.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, so sorry Maryann. We're going to have her on here to talk more about her actual school. But she is my co chair and has has been great, and helped out with several of these projects, including getting the statement we originally started on this statement, actually almost a year ago and it is an amalgamation of several statements that have been, you know, sort of squished together and reworked\r\nWe've gotten feedback from a good portion of the community. And I'm really glad to see that we finally been able to release it because it's taken a while.\r\nIt's hard to know where to start with this because it is such an important topic. And, you know, it almost it certainly feels like it shouldn't be squished into like our 15 to 20 minute timeframe.\r\nYou know there's there's so much that could that could be said about it. We've had some of our own experiences with issues of diversity inclusion and I'm sure lots of folks can pause a moment and think about instances where they've seen you know examples of problems with this or were having a statement like this might be helpful to them to have something to point to, I think it is really important for us as a group, maybe in part especially because we are so spread out in diverse and we do so much of our stuff online and it is so easy sometimes to be glib and to not, you know, to not take this stuff seriously, and it is an ongoing thing that we we all have to work at every day, so it's\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> It's easy to be a jerk on the internet. \r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yes it is so easy.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> So tell us a little bit about the, I guess the statement itself where you landed what what you prioritized in writing the statement.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, we spent a lot of time. These statements can really come across as kind of a, you know, like a laundry list of things that we're trying to cover and it's really hard to be inclusive, but also not be a laundry list of things. And I think we did a pretty good job with that we we hit on some of the high points. We had a little bit of help from our code of conduct, although I'm going to go ahead and mention that the our team, the diversity inclusion teams next project is to review the WPCampus code of conduct, because Rachel first wrote that which is starting to campus and that was about three years ago now.\r\nSo for those of you who are interested in this topic or would like to come back and take a look at that and give some feedback. If you look at the blog post announcing this we have a link in there to the the code of conduct, and then also to our document where we're beginning to do revisions. So if you have any feedback. We'd love to see that. But this the the diversity, equity inclusion document is really, we just tried to be as open as possible. I think one of the sentences in here that's\r\n\"We have enough experience to know. We won't get any of this perfect on the first try, but we have enough hope and energy and idealism to learn.\" So I 100% think that that is pointing to where we're hoping to go, which is, it would be totally false to think that you're going to, you know, address everything on the first go round or that you're going to write something that's kind of stand the test of time.\r\nAnd the plan is and should be to revise this like at least once a year. And I think that's our goal. And again, it's an important piece that we do that with the code of conduct as well.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Can you talk a little bit about like so when I'm reading this statement, there are a few things that stand out to me. One thing that really stands out is in the \"our principles\" section, the principles that you list: mutual respect, accessibility freedom and flexibility knowledge and creativity transparency peer support and public leadership and support. And this last to stand out to me as sort of\r\nI don't know as as as things I don't necessarily see in a lot of statements like this where you're making a commitment to to build in peer networks and also having your having the organizational leadership, that's Rachel, but also you as a conference co-chair there and other people in the group being very visible about this and vocal about this.\r\nI guess I don't have a question except to say I like that and you should talk now.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Okay!\r\nYeah so. So two points of this first one probably or support we interestingly, originally, I think we came at this was slightly different points of view, one being that we should provide leadership for people to put these into action, which I agree with, and also that we should by example. You know, lead by example, by having a statement like this and by using it. So when we went back to revise that we realized that we were coming at it with slightly different angles, both of which are really important and I hopefully we kind of merge them together nicely. But, but more to your point of how we exemplify this. You know, Rachel was the one who commissioned us writing the statement and I'm glad that she felt that it was important and that we should put time into it. \r\nYou know, I was trying to figure out why this feels so obviously part of the web campus culture. And I think that goes back to the fact that accessibility is a primary importance to us as well. That is part of our mandate as higher education institutions, but I think it's also a case for this statement that like you're never going to be successful at addressing the full range of accessibility issues until you are completely and totally inclusive of your community and of the experiences that people are having. And so that's an important piece to our community. And it's something that seems like kind of a no-brainer, but it's also obviously very important to say. So I think it's great that we, that we have this to point to.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> So I'm going to ask a couple of questions about how this connects to the in person event and other events in web campus world, whether it's the online event, whether it's so a couple of weeks ago, we had the webinar with folks at Tenon.\r\nSo we've been referencing for a very long time. This code of conduct that's going to be reviewed. How do you take a statement of diversity inclusion and equity and and turn that into something tangible that people see an experience as they're participating in the community.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> That's a good question. I think that it's hard. You know, it's not like this statement has action items in it.\r\nBut the diversity and inclusion team that's helped to write it does have action items and there are things that we're working on some of which we do hope to talk about at WPCampus 2019 coming up in Portland, Oregon. And so, I mean, we're working on a couple initiatives, including mentorship.\r\nAnd that's something that we hope to talk about a little bit more. And again, people we we love to have folks come and join us for our monthly meetings which take place the third Thursday of every month at 1pm CST so that's 2pm EST so if if people want to join us and in Slack for that. That would be great. There's a number of other initiatives that we sort of have you know, waiting, because we, the statement has taken a while. And there's been other things that we've been trying to work on. We have put out some speaker training which is available to watch anytime on the website. And the idea being that this is hopefully something that will help people who haven't traditionally spoken to get more comfortable with it.\r\nIt's not just for public speaking, but also for helping people to write a proposal to come up with ideas for presenting, and there, again, we want to try to be as inclusive as possible in our speaker lineup so getting more more people out, especially if you haven't spoken before, please go check out that training. Hopefully it's something that will inspire you to come up with some good topics or make you more comfortable when the time comes, we would love to get more people out. So those are those are some of the sorts of sorts of projects that we've been working on. \r\nAlso, I think Maryann, sorry, she is a member of the web team at ST. JOHN Fisher College in Rochester, New York, I knew Rochester had something to do with it.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Hi, Maryann. And I hope you listen. Don't hate us.\r\nSo if you listen to our episode two weeks ago you know that this is sort of a reboot of the WPCampus podcast and we're trying to stay quick and short and agile and any other any other buzzwords you can come up with.\r\nSynergy.\r\nSo we are trying to keep under the 15 to 20 minute mark. Jen, since you are kind of sort of a guest co host, we're going to treat you as a guest now.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> I get ice cream or something, right?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Um, the, the, you have to provide your own ice cream, but you're more than welcome. You're more than welcome to have ice cream.\r\nSo we're going to preview with you. We're, we're going to try our hand at a feature. A recurring segment. Which is to ask you a few questions about yourself and your institution and your hopes and dreams for WPcampus. \r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Okay, cool.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Okay, so first, where do you work? \r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> I work at NC State University in lovely, super-hot Raleigh NC.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> That's the one that's like the sky blue color right\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> We're gonna have to edit out some curse words right now. No, this is not the sky blue color one. This is the NC State Wolfpack we are red.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> And what is your official job title.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> I'm Web Services Coordinator.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> And what does that mean, what do you actually do?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> I do whatever my boss tells me to do. I, I, I chair the web services team I team lead for you guys, although like you don't really need a leader. I just pick different project management tools and move us in and out of them and then occasionally I get to do some development. Still, I talked to clients a lot. I do a lot of billing. I tried to help with some other direction for projects internal do OIT and for the rest of campus.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Yeah, that's good enough for me.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Sounds right. Yeah.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> If you have a degree what degree did you get and from whatever institution that was\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, I'm NC State all the way my undergrad is in textile and apparel business management. Comes in handy.\r\nMy master's degrees in Technical Communication, also from NC State.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> And finally, at the institution where you work who would win in a fight: your college mascot or Wapuu\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> So NC State has the wolf pack which, to me, even though our mascot is often shown as a lone wolf should indicate a group of wolves, and I don't think Wapuu can take down a group of wolves, the strength is in the pack and the pack is the strength. Right? Is that what it is?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Not so good.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Oh geez. Our most famous alumni ever whose name. I just blanked on, from The Hangover [zach galifianakis]. Um, yeah, so I'm pretty sure that cute and charming little Wapuu could could not take down and pack of wolves. Sorry, dude.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Yes, I feel like that one's kind of a gruesome one to start with segment with\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> I know right? I think if we start tracking the summer it's gonna get ugly.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> So Jen thank you very much for being a test run guest and also...\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> And can I go back to being obnoxious co host?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> You can be obnoxious all you want and also thank you for all the work that you do for the diversity and inclusion group you know i i really appreciate that this group exists and the statement exists and everything that you've done.\r\nI think it's good for the organization. And it's a model for other organizations to. \r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> I hope so. I hope so. And yes, as a reminder to folks, please do go to the website read through the statement, read the blog post where we have links to the code of conduct and you can add feedback in there. So yeah, we love feedback if you can join us for meetings and Slack. Again, that's the third Thursdays of the month, and we'd love to have you. What are we talking about next week, Brian.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> I think next week we're, well, are we going to have a schedule for the conference next week?\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, I do think that the 2019 conference. We're contacting people now and getting confirmations. But the schedule is more or less in place. So yeah, I think, talking about what what to expect to the conference might be a good plan.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> So we'll try to bring in some good guests. Talk about that and talk about what we're excited about for the summer's event important one.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> I am super excited about the schedule. We had a lot of great submissions. This year it was it was hard to pick stuff out. And I think we're gonna have my biggest problem is going to be figuring out where I need to be\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> So with all of that you can read the diversity, equity, and inclusion statement at WPCampus.org, you can register for the conference for this year summer event at 2019.WPCampus.org you can listen to this and other episodes of the podcast via iTunes and Google Play and other things probably or by going to WPCampus.org/podcast.\r\nAnd if you have any complaints, which I'm sure you do for some if there's praise (which is almost certainly for Jen and not for me because I've fumbled all over this podcast) you can tweet at wpcampusorg or tweet directly at Jen at ncsumarit or tweet at me at briandeconinck. Good luck selling that\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Haven't you given this to your mom wasn't too. I think she's gonna send you nice thoughts.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> My, my mother. Hi. I love my mother dearly. I don't think she needs to listen to this.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> I'm sure you have someone who would say nice things to you, Brian.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Somebody. Yeah.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> There's also a transcript. I want to mention that we're as part of this reboot. We're making sure that we have transcripts for all these. So if that is more your jam. If you'd rather read and listen, that is going to be available on the website as well.","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"62dc2d31-a706-5fbb-9147-ee2946d25293","wordpress_id":233,"count":3,"name":"Diversity and Inclusion","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/diversity-inclusion/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"5438d635-e187-55e6-981b-4493983d1f75","wordpress_id":35419,"slug":"after-the-audit","path":"/podcast/after-the-audit/","author":[{"id":"cc224cb0-f32b-5840-9d1d-c512c0de8162","path":"briandeconinck","display_name":"Brian DeConinck","email":"bpdeconi@ncsu.edu","twitter":"BrianDeConinck","website":"http://www.briandeconinck.com/","company":"NC State University","company_position":"Front-End Designer & Developer","bio":"I build custom themes and plugins for NC State University's Office of Information Technology, and I help maintain campus WordPress environments and advise clients on content best practices.

With support from over 100 donors and a generous donation from Automattic, WPCampus commissioned an independent accessibility audit.

This is the WPCampus Podcast, for those who use WordPress in higher education. I think that's what we say, right?\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yes!\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> When last you heard us --\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Who are you Brian?\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Oh yeah, I'm Brian! That's Jen!\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> And we are, we both work for NC State University. Brian is your official host, I am your \"color commentary.\" Air quotes for those of you not watching on video at home.\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> We used to do this sort of once a month with gaps, and then we went like a year with nothing, and now we're back!\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Let's be fair, it was more like nine months.\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> It was like eleven months.\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Ten? We'll say ten.\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Alright. And now we're back, and now we're trying this in a less structured and less formal way.\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> You may have already noticed the less structure.\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> In hopes of getting something out the door on a more regular basis, because it turns out that spending time prepping and finding guests and making a quality product takes time.\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Well, to be fair you should all know that Brian basically wrote out everything that he needed to say, whereas I just talk, so we'll see how the quality declines, see how the quality goes downhill really quickly. But we're hoping that this format change will result in us being able to get more podcasts out to you more quickly. Although we are also planning to have much shorter podcasts, so we'll be going from like the 45 minute to an hour time frame to something more like 15 to 20 minute time frame. We will happily take advice or feedback from our listeners, and by our listeners I mean our co-workers here at NC State and Brian's mom.\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Just just for the record I don't think our co-workers here at NC State or my mom actually listen, but if you do listen be sure to tweet @wpcampusorg with your requests or hate mail or whatever you'd love to share. \r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> You can also send tweets to @ncsumarit on Twitter and Brian what's yours?\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> @BrianDeConinck \r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah and those might actually be better because otherwise if you tweet it to @wpcampusorg then they're just gonna fire us.\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> So do we want to actually talk about something important and useful?\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah I do, and the good news is we're starting at a very opportune time for this and that is because the infamous accessibility audit has finally been completed just this week. Brian joined Tenon, the vendor who worked on the project for us, on Monday and sort of did a recap and so we're gonna let him talk here for a while, fill up most of these 15 minutes sort of recapping some of this. That's not entirely true we're gonna we're gonna recap it quickly because most of you have probably read some amount of recap, and-or you read all how many pages?\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Like three hundred twenty nine\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Right, pages of the report. If you did, like, pat yourself on the back right now. Congratulations. You and Brian and Rachel are maybe the only people who did, which isn't to say that's not worth your time it completely is, and that's why we're gonna try and recap it here. But then we're also gonna move on hopefully pretty quickly to the takeaways both for WordPress in general and then also maybe for higher education specifically. So Brian: recap it! TL;DR it.\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> So long ago, far back in the mists of time\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Whoa whoa whoa too far \r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Last fall summer/summer fall time period some people may remember feelings being expressed by people in the WordPress community about the accessibility, or inaccessibility, of the Gutenberg editor. And there was some back-and-forth in the community about an independent audit potentially funded by Automattic that didn't come to be at that point. And so people in the WPCampus community said \"hey, let's get together and fund our own audit! Because at the institutional level it's kind of hard to make decisions based on angry tweets and blog posts. So wouldn't it be nice to have actual information?\" And so fast forward six months or so and we have a fantastic report in terms of the depth and just the wealth of information available provided by the accessibility vendor that WPCampus worked with, Tenon, and Tenon provided a 34 page executive summary 329 pages of a long form technical report, another like seven or eight pages describing their usability testing, and then some additional stuff that, like a CSV export and things like that. And I think there might be a little bit more from them coming in the next couple of weeks about the usability testing as well.\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> I know you mentioned that in the Tenon talk on Monday what you found most interesting was some of that usability feedback that they just expressed over discussion. Can you share some of that?\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Yeah, so, the the technical accessibility side, all of the code errors that that they identified, or issues that they identified, that's all very important and that's sort of low-hanging fruit. The Tenon auditors gave a lot of really good information and code snippets for exactly what needs to be changed and the WordPress community, the Gutenberg team, they've already hit the ground running on that. I have open right here the GitHub project that they used to organize the issues Tenon identified. Out of 90 issues identified, 46 have already been closed. \r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> That's great, wow.\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Right and that's some mix of things that had already been fixed but hadn't been pushed production yet.\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> They pushed what, five-two-one?\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Right, so 5.2 was released last week and 5.2.1 will be coming soon. And then some of these are also things that they just Tenon identified and they were easier, relatively quick fixes and they've already acted on it. So that's great! In terms of the technical accessibility issues, we're over halfway there already. But the the usability issues are a little trickier and that gets to areas of cognitive load, it's just a very complicated editor, and if you don't have the visual cues of being able to see this is here and that's there, it's a lot keep track of if you're using assistive technology like a screen reader. The editor, the DOM order is confusing and sometimes overwhelming for users if you're tabbing through the content. A lot of the block options that you'd need to get to to customize your block are nowhere near the block itself, you have to have all the way through your content over to the sidebar to get there. So things like that. And that's sort of for the WordPress project as next steps, I think there has to be some soul-searching and some rethinking about what does, what does this editor actually feel like to the users who are using it and how does it need to change? And that's also important too because more and more of WordPress is just going to become Guten-ized as as the project moves forward, whether it's the widgets screen or the navigation menus, or pieces of themes that normally we think of as just being hard-coded PHP or theme options for things like that.\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, if there's one thing we can count on it's more blocks. \r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Right. And so, you know, the editor in a lot of ways is the hardest part. But getting it right and getting an accessible will help make sure that the rest of the WordPress product becomes more accessible as all this happens too.\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, and it is, you know, to give credit where credit is due, it is a super, as you mentioned it's a very complex interface and to some extent that complexity is gonna be necessary to make WordPress more of what it needs to be, which is more focused on, you know, its CMS functionality, and abstracting out content, and reusing content, and all that stuff. And a lot of the page builders obviously that are out there that are very popular and some people still point to in preference over Gutenberg, they're not subject to this kind of scrutiny. But at the same time those are not things that we're gonna use in higher education, or at least not, those aren't the things that were gonna make broadly available because they'll have accessibility issues. And so those aren't getting looked at. So it is it is a tough job for everybody, but it's good that they're... \r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> And to that point one of the things Karl Groves from Tenon said in the webinar that I thought it was, I think a good thing for everybody hear, was that, you know, that when they look at Gutenberg and they test it, it does have serious accessibility issues but what they identified was very much consistent with other products though they test. And Gutenberg gets a lot of public scrutiny because it's an open-source product that's out in the open and we conduct this audit so that information would be available to campuses to make decisions and so that information is public. If you're Microsoft or Apple or some somebody out in the corporate world and you commissioned an accessibility audit, you don't broadcast those results. And so, you know. I think making Gutenberg and making WordPress the most accessible product in CMS land that's out there, that's a that's a huge task. But it's also an important task, and, I mean, speaking for myself I'm excited I got to be a part of this whole thing.\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, I'm gonna detour for a second to do a really important and obligatory thank you to you, for all your hard work, but also to Rachel and the rest of the team that helped put together the RFP, and then review all the options. Also to all the people who put money in. Also obviously, to Matt Mullenweg who helped, you know, fill in the gap where it was needed so that we could get this paid for. And I think we all have some really useful information. I know for us, for our campus, we have been holding off on making the block editor available in sort of our open public -- and by public I mean university, the whole university facing multi-site environment -- so our free WordPress environment is still using the classic editor, but we are planning to move to making the block editor available for people with the caveat that hey here's this accessibility audit and if you're someone who might have these kinds of constraints or concerns, you may want to consider holding off, or come and talk to us about where the major impacts are gonna lie for you. But I feel like that's doing are you know that's doing a good job of compromising between the people who can and do want to use it, and still keeping the classic editor available until we're sure that it's really functional for everybody. \r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Right, and this is, I mean, this is a tricky thing in higher ed when you're trying to make things accessible but you're also trying to keep up with how things are moving in the web. You know, I remember, I don't remember where this was, I remember at some point I read something, I'm doing a great job sourcing my information, so somebody said something along the lines of like, \"institutional accessibility is about risk management.\" Which is just that, you know, every higher ed institution is going to use products that aren't 100% accessible because there are not very many products that are 100% accessible, and you pick and choose, and you try to go with the best options that are available and you limit and mitigate your risk when you need to. And I think, you know, for our campus we've been working with our IT accessibility coordinator, a wonderful person Crystal Tenan who--\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> No relation to Tenon.\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Right, one letter away from Tenon. You know, I made that typo so many times doing all this audit stuff, like the blog posts, every time I was thinking Tenan and instead of Tenon. Anyway, so you know, we worked with our accessibility coordinator, she's been involved in all of our Gutenberg decision-making, basically from the start, when we started working with Gutenberg.\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, she got here just in time.\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> And you know the line that we sort of came down on is, if you own a website, if you are an administrator for a website, know your users and know whether or not you're creating barriers for them. And if you have any concerns, then you should stick with the classic editor, and if you're ready to take, you know, stick that toe into the troubled waters the block editor then then we can start moving in that direction a little at a time. And, I mean, I think none of this changes the fact that blocks are still the future of WordPress.\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> And I'm still excited about it and I know a lot of folks on campus are too.\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Right, like, I think, I think there's a lot that higher ed especially will benefit from with blocks. Reusable content and structured content with block templates, and all that stuff that we talked about when we gave a talk at WPCampus last year if you were in St. Louis when you saw us.\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> That's shameless self-promotion.\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Shameless self-promotion.\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> We'll try to keep that to a minimum on this on this show.\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> I mean sometimes we might have guests and let them--\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> -- self-promote --\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> -- but this time it's just you and me, so I'm gonna promote us.\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> All right, so that's basically it for our time, but hopefully you will see us much more regularly in your little podcast stream over the next, over the, in the future so I think that's just about it. Brian, do you have anything to tease for  next time?\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Well, I guess first, we should have told them where they can go to read the audit, that seems like something we should have started with! So if you go to dev5290.wpcampus.org/audit, and if you have any questions about the audit either for us who organized it, or for the Tenon team that we can pass along, there's an email address: audit@dev5290.wpcampus.org.\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Good job doing the important work there.\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Right, and, gosh, what else do we need to say?\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Hey, there's a conference coming up!\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Oh yeah, that thing!\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> You guys should come to our conference! We are very excited to be in Portland, Oregon. Don't go to Maine, please, July 25th to the 27th.\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Portland, Maine is lovely\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Oh, no, you should go to Portland, Maine it is beautiful, but not for the conference, nobody will be there for that. At least not this year. So yes, and that is 2019.dev5290.wpcampus.org and, yeah, I think that's that's pretty much it.\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> The schedule should be coming out very soon\r\n</p><p><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, we're finishing up that process and looking to get that out hopefully next week so that might be something we talk about next time. And, that's it we're we're all out of time, so thank you very much for listening, Mom, I really appreciate it. And Dad, happy birthday, Dad. Is it awkward now?\r\n</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> How do we finish this?","comment_status":"open","categories":[{"id":"1424af51-c47c-5703-9504-357a62a9ec60","wordpress_id":69,"count":15,"name":"Accessibility","description":"","path":"/blog/categories/accessibility/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"12bf14a7-76ee-5b80-9913-a4f8ee45ac2c","wordpress_id":26661,"slug":"multisite-campuspress","path":"/podcast/multisite-campuspress/","author":[{"id":"cc224cb0-f32b-5840-9d1d-c512c0de8162","path":"briandeconinck","display_name":"Brian DeConinck","email":"bpdeconi@ncsu.edu","twitter":"BrianDeConinck","website":"http://www.briandeconinck.com/","company":"NC State University","company_position":"Front-End Designer & Developer","bio":"I build custom themes and plugins for NC State University's Office of Information Technology, and I help maintain campus WordPress environments and advise clients on content best practices.

It's easy to get caught up in the energy and the drama of changes like that, but they're not really why people use WordPress in higher ed.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">So why do we use WordPress? What makes it such a valuable tool?</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">A big part of the answer to those questions is WordPress multisite.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">My name is Brian DeConinck, and I work at NC State University. I'm joined today by my colleague and co-host Jen McFarland and by Ronnie Burt. Ronnie works with CampusPress, a President-level sponsor for the 2018 WPCampus conference, and he's here to showcase some of CampusPress's clients and talk about what makes multisite such a great fit for so many different higher ed use cases.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">Welcome, Ronnie!</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Ronnie:</strong> Thank you very much for having me.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Brian:</strong> Oh we're really happy to have you. So I guess for--- so our university, NC State does not use CampusPress. (Sorry about that.)</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Jen:</strong> Full disclosure.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Brian:</strong> I know a lot of campuses do. For people who don't know what you guys do and what services you offer... what do you do?</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Ronnie:</strong> Yeah so we are, we're basically one of if not the first managed hosts around, exclusively with multisite for the past 10 years or so. So we are first and foremost a managed host for WordPress multisite and with CampusPress exclusively within education so both K12 and higher ed.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">A little more than half of our business is higher ed. We work with a couple hundred universities worldwide about a little more than half of those are in the U.S. here and so it is WordPress multisite that's all we do and it's a little bit of everything within multisite. So we host it we support it we handle change management, testing, upgrading of WordPress core.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">We can do end-user support so if it's a site for faculty or for students they can reach out to our support team 24/7 instead of a university's helpdesk.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">We have a ton of plugins and resources and tools that we've developed over the years that are available kind of out of the box so it's it's kind of more than just the managed hosting. We take ownership of the entire code base of WordPress including the plugins, including the themes. We do reviews of those just to keep things running as close to a hundred percent of the time as possible and as fast as possible.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">CampusPress itself is part of a little bit larger WordPress company where WordPress is all that we do. Our sister company is WPMU Dev, so lots of universities that may not be using CampusPress might be using services and plugins and tools from WPMU Dev and they actually share a lot of the same resources you see a lot of the same stuff across the two and the same team.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Brian:</strong> And we do use WPMU Dev so we like you guys for that. So what's your role with CampusPress?</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Ronnie:</strong> We're a little weird with titles in our company but I guess if when I have to you know when it goes to contracts and things I’m general manager CampusPress and that kind of sheperd the the growth that we do, the sales side, the product development side and just making sure that everything that we do with CampusPress you know is going strong and always getting better. I also work across and some of the business development side of WPMU Dev and in the fact that we have shared resources there we do managed hosting on the enterprise level with WPMU Dev as well and it's essentially the same team and product. So that's in a nutshell what I do a little bit of everything it changes everyday.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Jen:</strong> How long have you been around?</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Ronnie:</strong> I've been with the company now for a little over eight years. When I started CampusPress had a different name of Edublogs campus. Edublogs is still around as well its mot K-12 it's one large multisite network. It's actually, we were pretty confident that it's the oldest multisite network on the web.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Jen:</strong> I believe that yeah I remember it being around a long time ago.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Ronnie:</strong> It was launched before WordPress.com as an MU and it's got a little over four million blogs going strong, you know, really popular especially in the K-12 market with teachers for blogging sites and things like that. And we use that that's kind of where everything started WPMU Dev came out of Edublogs we were building a lot of stuff for Edublogs and people were like what we want that so we turned that into a business. So multisite is really been the focus of our company from the beginning.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Jen:</strong> Did you say four million?</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Ronnie:</strong> Yeah there's about there's a little over four million blogs on that on multisite.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Jen:</strong> That's impressive!</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Ronnie:</strong> It’s a beast and they're not they're not all active but you know over the course of that network's over 12 years old.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Jen:</strong> I was excited about like our twenty five thousand, but four million!</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Ronnie:</strong> It’s quite the database and it’s given us a lot of you know experience and scale and it's a lot. That's where I got personally got started I was a classroom teacher in middle school and in high school math and was using WordPress with some of my stuff and came across Edublogs and it eventually snowballed into a job. I was kind of the first non-technical person, well second non-technical person on the team there.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Jen:</strong> Brian's got a math degree too, you guys can have some math fun, I’ll just sit here and laugh at you guys.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Brian:</strong> Yeah. Jen has a textiles management degree.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, really big on the math.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Brian:</strong> So all that's awesome. So when we were emailing back and forth before the show you sent me a few links to some of your clients who are using multisite in different ways. It's hard to do like demos or showcase in an audio format, but let's talk through maybe a few of the sites you shared with us. If there's one in particular you want to start with go right ahead.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Ronnie:</strong> Well I think I'll just emphasize that no two installations are the same and no to kind of implementations of how our customers are using WordPress and WordPress multisite are the same so it's everything from the very top level main site, providence.edu is an example of that, where you know it's their main web presence the home page and university, plus the different departments and everything that comes with being the top-level main site.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">And to be honest that is on the newer side for us. We got our start you know through Edublogs, through the learning side, through classroom blogs and stuff like that. But that's also 10, 12 years ago when WordPress was a blogging tool and is now known for you know being the CMS of choice and so it's only natural that we see more and more typical CMS use with WordPress and multisite.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">So you know a benefit of your main site like Providence.edu is so your admission site can be a sub-site on the network and you can just give someone or a small group of people in admissions access to edit the content of just their site but they won't have access to edit like you know someone else's site on the network or the main website. WordPress permissions are pretty good for that it's totally extendable and I'm preaching to the choir if you're listening to a WordPress podcast but you know what we see some of the cool things that we're seeing with top-level sites and across all the sites that's kind of related to main sites is things you can do with content syndication so we have a post indexer plugin that will index all of the posts and custom post types across a multisite network and then you can use short codes or template tags or different ways of displaying that content across the network. So if you have a tag that if it gets used anywhere in the multisite installation, then it's gonna highlight that post on the main website. So it's just an easy way of kind of syndicating the content or re posting I mean anything from just the title of the post to the full body and text of the post that way</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">So that's kind of a cool implementation. You also you know work through the strengths of WordPress and that is extendable, it's easy to develop, the theme share a common theme or set of themes across all of your sites and that sort of stuff just makes a lot of sense. And I think that we're seeing more and more main site implementations as time goes on, as people are you know every whatever it may be 5, 7, 10 year cycle of updating that main website and WordPress is becoming more and more used there.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Brian:</strong> Well and I mean it makes sense as a is just a way of consolidating and managing your web presence. So at NC State we don't have our main homepage is not part of a multisite with the rest of our departmental sites and college sites. But we did just over the last few years go through this long exercise, of it's still sort of ongoing, of bringing everybody on board with a new brand and having everything centralized on a single environment certainly makes that easier.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Ronnie:</strong> For sure, definitely. I mean and I know that you mentioned in the in the pre-show and the pre-previous discussions of GDPR or even our US customers we're getting questions about easy way of adding cookie notices and privacy policies across all other sites that they have never had to really think about before having it in a simple multisite or single multisite has made that process easier for many of the customers.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">And so then I guess beyond them, the main sites, kind of our bread and butter but the typical customer if we had to have one that we would describe is kind of a self-service, on-demand WordPress multisite platform where faculty, students, staff or whoever's affiliated with university can go to a landing page click login and create a site or multiple sites within the multisite network.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">So there's lots of examples of those. u.osu.edu at Ohio State, that's, I like that one because it's a nice short easy URL to share but it's also a very branded installation. So every site there is using one of just a few themes that they've developed in-house that are branded, matched the university marketing guidelines and webstyle guidelines and all that sort of good stuff. But any student, Ohio State’s the largest or one of the top two or three largest universities in the in the US right, that's a lot of students that can just go and create a site that's a WordPress site there. And they don't have to worry about you know what getting too big what how long they might just be using it for a course that lasts a couple of months or they might travel with them throughout the the entire four years that they're in the program or whatever it may be. Faculty as well, faculty sites it's just a out-of-the-box WordPress platform for anyone to use.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Brian:</strong> So when you're working with the university they're setting up a like a self-service system like this, are you involved in, or can you be involved in deciding policy, helping them figure out how to govern that kind of an environment, what the rules should be, things like that?</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Ronnie:</strong> Yes, we definitely can be and we like to be. So the fact that we're lucky and that we will we've worked with a good number of of universities doing something similar, the best thing we can do is share what we've seen work well and what maybe we haven't seen work as well in the past. And also try to make connections of folks doing similar things, so they can talk directly to each other. So definitely do those sorts of things. At least half especially of these kind of self-service platforms that we have are migrations for us, so they are self hosting it or they're hosting it elsewhere and then you know we come into the process. So in that case a lot of times the policies are already set, and sometimes it's a good thing and/or it's a bad thing. If they have a ton of plugins that they've just added to it over the years you know it can take a while to kind of go through them and help kind of clean up the network so we're comfortable with you know ongoing maintenance of it and that sort of thing. But that's another big part of why no two implementations are the same. So some customers are totally happy with anyone and everyone come create a site, create whatever you want, do whatever you want with it. Others want a very rigorous kind of request form that has to go through someone pre-approves and then it goes to another person that can approve it that's really a site that needs to be created and it's a very manual process. So we definitely run the gamut between those those two sort of extremes in terms of policies there and then policies in terms of brand adverse unbranded.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">So for example the next one on the list with sites.dartmouth.edu, Dartmouth University it's a recent migration for us, theirs is not very branded at all I don't I don't even know if they have any I think they might have a couple of branded themes but you can choose to not be branded. So you just, a lot of the WordPress themes that that we've accumulated over the years that are just out there on on you know the WordPress.org repo, those sorts of themes that the people can do anything they want with with those sites, there's a little bit less kind of policies, approval, governance on those.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Jen:</strong> Is that more of a challenge for you because then you have more overhead in terms of support for those kinds of things?</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Ronnie:</strong> Yes and no. I mean we, we try to offer as many themes and plugins and things like that we have committed to supporting ongoing. So we know when we do an update for it for one customer it's going to be an update for it for all customers, so we're okay with that. And we're very careful in the plugins and themes that that we select, for example themes in the last two or three years we're only adding themes that have been reviewed by a third-party as accessibility ready. That greatly limits the number of themes like if it doesn't meet that tag we're not we're not going to accept it. So there's things that we can put in our policies to kind of make sure that that we're comfortable maintaining it long term. So does that make sense?</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Jen:</strong> Absolutely, yeah, you know, I'm just like trying to glean ideas here too because a lot of the same problems with you know there's plugin bloat over time, there's theme bloat over time. We're more of the Dartmouth model where people can use multiple things but we do have some campus themes so, yeah, it's the challenge.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Ronnie:</strong> It is. I mean one thing that we've done recently that we didn't do for years and years and years is start retiring themes and plugins.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Jen:</strong> I was gonna ask about that, and sites too - like how often do you go through and clean out old sites, or do you?</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Ronnie:</strong> Well we don't for the customers, but some customers do choose to do that. So we have a scripting tool that's built in where you can run a script to see when the last time the site was updated, download a CSV of those sites and then we can we can mass archive them if they haven't been updated in X amount of time. So some customers will do that, others, I've always been of the belief that once it's on the web it should be on the web forever for the most part with it with some, I mean I understand the governance reasons and the privacy like it's easier to have less data but if it was published---</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Jen:</strong> Records retention people love you!</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Ronnie:</strong> But if it was public on the web someone published it on the web for a reason. They didn't give it a sunset date you know</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Brian:</strong> I’m sure database administrators feel differently.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Ronnie:</strong> Yes, yes but you know people are, for the most obvious reasons, people might be linking to that somewhere and now even created broken dead links around the web. I just, I feel like if it's a public site it typically needs to live ongoing.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Jen:</strong> I like your argument, I'm gonna steal it the next time somebody ask me why were cleaning up our stuff.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Ronnie:</strong> But there's also you know you have less footprints is is less to worry about. So I get that and. It also depends on the purpose of the site. So on our networks that are more course focused that our sites typically are first of all for a learning purpose and that course is long over</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, very different model.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Ronnie:</strong> Then a faculty site who published some research or you know information about even the historical stuff on an event that took place years ago is a nice public record to have in my opinion. But that's--- we do make the tools available you know in WordPress multisite you can do database scripts and all sorts of things like that to pull out what you're looking for contact those people make sure they want it to archive. What we typically do is not fully delete as we archive so it's not live on the web and then we can easily just unarchive. But then that data is still living in your database so it doesn't really help that problem.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">So there so there's those then there's kind of hybrid networks. The the host University for WPCampus, WUSTL, Wash U, sites.wustl.edu, they're an example where they have their main WordPress website or their main website is WordPress I'm pretty sure but that's not part of the multisite network that we host. And so then it's lots of department events, academic groups, their med school things like that that are on that but it's a fully branded, everything's branded kind of through their main their main web team for example.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">And so, you know I keep kind of going through the list, there's the other kind of not extreme but other use case of back to the learning so between course blogs or portfolios, so edblogs.columbia.edu is an interesting example. It's out of their, I don't I don't always get the department or the organization completely correct, but this is in their instructional technology side of things and you know ran by the same folks that are managing their LMS and things like that. So it's a WordPress implementation the idea is if a course needs a WordPress site or a blog that's public outside of the LMS then they go here and it's an on-demand platform for the course.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">There's some cool things you can do there with LTI integrations or canvas API integrations for kind of pre-creating these courses or auto adding students to WordPress and things like that we've either found or built or improved upon over time. So those are some pretty cool implementations, and eportfolios is always a it's a buzzword that's been around for a long time and it comes and goes.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah, always comes back, pops up.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Ronnie:</strong> Yeah it does and I've seen some really good implementations and then I mean what it takes is kind of a, it's one of those that you can't just kind of wing and throw out there and hope that something sticks. It's one that an our experience takes some pretty big just planning and organization wide like making sure that the follow through iss going to be there, to make sure that something like that is gonna be worth it. And oftentimes those sites might be private, there's portfolio.newschool.edu, that's an example because they have a pretty extensive portfolio process. And you know, I've seen more and more and more of those come out and often times they're kind of smaller implementations because it's at a single department or maybe for a single course or a single major or whatever it is and not some sort of university-wide implementation.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Brian:</strong> So you said earlier that a lot of the customers that you have are already coming in with an existing network or something like that. For the customers who are coming in cold with with no existing network do you find that they usually have a clear idea of what they want they made these decisions about like how they want their course network or course multisite to function or, I guess what's the preparedness level that you you see a lot of your clients in?</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Ronnie:</strong> Yeah I mean it does vary. Oftentimes it's as simple as we talked to someone here and we want that you know so that's handy.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Brian:</strong> Give me what Columbia has.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Ronnie:</strong> Yeah, exactly. So that's kind of what I see. Maybe they ran into each other at a conference and had a conversation typically by the time they're talking to us they're familiar with WordPress and we're not selling them on WordPress. That used to not always be the case but it's much easier, we don't have to go into why you should use WordPress to begin with for the most part. So they have an idea of WordPress, how it works. They're not always familiar with multisite they might be more familiar with kind of single site implementation so kind of going through what you can do with multisite and what those sort of tools that it brings to the table is big in the process that we can kind of identify exactly what it is that they're trying to achieve, what that pain point is that you know our problem that they're trying to solve.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Brian:</strong> Mm-hmm. And then so, I guess when they come in, let me let me ask it this way, have you ever had anybody surprise to you with the request? Do you find that a lot of the things\r\nuniversities are looking for basically fit into well-established categories? Or do you ever have anybody come in with a really wild multisite?</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Ronnie:</strong> Um, I mean sometimes the wild would be if they want to just make, like there might be an example of not wanting to use WordPress at all, and do everything on the front end and find some third party that will, that pretends to allow you to do that and then you're kind of taking away the purpose of WordPress to begin with.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Jen:</strong> You have to talk off the ledge before you--</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Ronnie:</strong> Yeah it's kind of like well, you know like the WordPress Dashboard isn't that scary we should we should allow them in there. Your users will probably want that over something else. So kind of talking, because I think it was good, I liked where they were coming from make sense they wanted like a kind of a Squarespace implementation of totally on the front end they can't mess anything up and and all that sort of good stuff. But our users are, once they get into something they're gonna want to make more changes they're gonna want more more features, more plugins or whatever that we wouldn't be able to support. Plus a lot of times I guess the crazy things, I don't want to use the word crazy--</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Jen:</strong> You can use crazy.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Ronnie:</strong> But the challenging things that we get are request for specific plugins or maybe specific themes that our gut feeling or research is just showing that this may not be something that's gonna be around long term. Right? And I and I hate to set customers up for failure of the future is, like, we can't support this. So there are lots of projects that have come up over the years I can't remember some of the names but some that do like that make a lot of sense it would be really useful for publishing research or sharing like, I can't think of what it's called, but academic journals listing and things like that so when faculty have published these sorts of things, so these plugins that are out there they often are tied to a theme or something like that, but you can just tell that they're it may not have the project may not have legs to to be around long term. So I don't want you to build an entire multisite network around it and then we will be up the creek later. Same with like choosing some fantastic-looking ThemeForest theme that answered you know every prayer you've ever had--</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Jen:</strong> You didn’t have to say ThemeForest because it was assumed but yes.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Ronnie:</strong> Yes, you know, I've used there's some great but it's an open Wild West market, they do some reviews and things like that but it's not the same. Like it's an independent developer and you don't know what's gonna happen with it later. So you don't want to put all of your your stock in your in your site based on that knowing that it may not be updated in the future or around or work well in the future.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Jen:</strong> And do you have people who you know come to you and ask for plugins that do something that another plugin already does or that theme or---</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Ronnie:</strong> Yeah, every single day.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Jen:</strong> So how do you, just like pointing back to that other thing and say we're not gonna like keep adding to this environment?</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Ronnie:</strong> Yeah and it's people seem to understand more and more I mean part of it is we tried to develop the largest, you know, as large of a plugin kind of recommended plugin lists that we can support as possible that does you know ninety something percent of what everyone needs to do.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">So we start with that and then oftentimes I find that what people want to plug-in that does something and they can just use embed code or something like that it's like well it's just so much easier for us to just use some embed code. And not just easier but future-proofed and all sorts of things like that, so we definitely go through the plugin vetting game. I think that's a big part of kind of the education process when we onboard a new customer, especially if they're not familiar with them. If they've been hosting it themselves and they're moving it to us they they understand that pain and they're kind of happy for us to take it on. If they're kind of newer to it, and the end users, I mean I understand, you know a gung-ho faculty member who is used to going to the WordPress repo or wherever and uploading whatever plug-in I understand their frustration. But we're you know we just have to explain why we're doing this in the best interest in the long-term health of the website in general and multisite network.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Jen:</strong> So do you have any governance or policies to back that up to say like--</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Ronnie:</strong> We do.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Jen:</strong> Yeah okay, so if somebody's really pushing it you can say well look at the end of the day this is just not something we're gonna do because X.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Ronnie:</strong> Right, we have code guidelines. So functions and and things like that that we just will not support. So we can often point to one of those and these sorts of plugins or themes. We also will do performance analysis and we can prove that look there's a big performance hit here with this and that's not something you really want. We can always go back to--- even things that say they're accessibility friendly we can always find some accessibility problems with just about anything unfortunately. So there's different tricks that that we use to kind of prove our point, knowing that we also don't ever say no without trying to give some sort of alternative.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Jen:</strong> Absolutely, yeah.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Brian:</strong> So this, I guess I think this file is pretty smoothly from that, sometimes higher ed can get a little political. Sometimes people can have strong feelings you don't have to name any names certainly but--</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Jen:</strong> No, no one has strong feelings Brian!</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Brian:</strong> I guess is it ever a challenge you know, College X or University X has a new vice chancellor for whatever, and they want to totally change everything or they don't understand why they have this relationship with CampusPress, or something like that, you ever run into?</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Jen:</strong> I’m sure that’s just us.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Ronnie:</strong> No, no it's common and in there, you know, the fact that people are moving in and out of different roles all the time is a big factor in there I think. You know, what's helped us is we try to typically have one, maybe two main contacts with a customer and that's pretty much the only person that we deal with. That we communicate with and talk to and so they're kind of the filter. So we're not, I mean, we do have calls and meetings like that with large groups and sometimes that kind of stuff comes up you can tell that there's you know different views on how we should achieve things in that group but we filter it all through that that main contact, and that's it's kind of that might be the only person we listen to.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Jen:</strong> That's a great idea, we should do that, Brian, and you should be that filter. We should do that.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Brian:</strong> That was a very good answer, and you navigated the trap that I set for you very nicely. So I want to shift gears for just a second. Edublogs has four million sites you said, you also have a lot of different clients, a lot of K-12 and university clients all around the world and I assume many of those multisites themselves have thousands of sites in them. That is an unbelievable scale that you're working at, like maybe second only to like Automattic. How do you, I guess how do you do that?</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Jen:</strong> Oh yeah give us the goods.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Brian:</strong> How do you manage on that kind of scale all the different multisite installations?</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Jen:</strong> Is it magic, it’s magic isn’t it?</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Ronnie:</strong> To me it's magic. So we've invested a ton in moving to AWS which has changed all of our lives in many ways. So we for years were with Pier One, became Server Beach, and we still have some some legacy stuff there. So we've always managed the servers ourselves, I mean we've always been involved in the day-to-day management of setting up the infrastructure and how it all works and things like that. But as we were able to move into AWS, that's allowed us to do things like, first of all, much easier to offer data center options for our customers outside of the US. You know in the EU, in Australia things like that. So locally and as laws have changed significantly you know the need for that is now that's a given you have to do something like that. When before we were like all in one data center in San Antonio down the road for me and Pier One.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">So that's, investing a lot in AWS and in learning all the different tools that we can do there with AWS has been has been critical. Setting up what we do for redundancy so that, you know when there's a problem at least there's an alternative there to, to not have the sites go down and things like that. You know and that's not, that's cheaper to do at scale than it is to do for an individual site so we have kind of the benefit of that and actually our overall hosting costs have gone down since moving to AWS, which is good. Well until we start adding in other services and additional backups and dedicated and stuff like that.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">But I mean my answer really is, we have a team, it's been a lot of trial and error, you know, there were growing pains that our customers would openly admit to through the years that led us to to the move. So some of the technical kind of roadblocks that we had to overcome some of the big ones that are interesting to talk about the first is in a multisite install, particularly like a course blog or something like that where you might have a class of 500 students in a chemistry class logging into WordPress at the same time to do something. Concurrent logged in users is a challenge at scale. I mean it's more than just that class right then you have all the other sites on the network and things like that.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Jen:</strong> I think higher education has to be unique in this I mean it's something that we see as well. Obviously logged in users but also just, you know, first day of school, first week of school, everybody hits stuff at the same time. And, you know, you can kind of count on it being a problem but you can't always count on all the sites that are gonna be an issue, or where that problem’s gonna pop up, so it's always it's always kind of fascinating that first week or two and then of course people stopped going to class and it's not a problem anymore.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Ronnie:</strong> Well that's true, and I mean we see, our hosting costs in August/September are substantially higher than the middle of the winter. And so you know you can see what that traffic and things like that I'm just being prepared and it is a unique in that aspect it also multisite, dealing with SSL Certificates, and the fact that I still don't understand the hundred domain limit on a on a cert, makes-- I mean I'm sure there's a good reason for it but I've never had researched it too much other than to know that that hundred domain limit is there and that's a massive pain point.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Jen:</strong> We've done enough with with SSL certs and vhosting and I can't imagine what it's like with 4 million sites.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Ronnie:</strong> Yeah I mean luckily most of those it's just a wild-card cert or something like that. But also you know universities don't like to provide wildcard certs for the most part. So it's kind of a you know we want you to host all of these sites for us but we don't want you to have the tools you need to do that sometimes, is a is a governance issue that we hit across sometimes. You know when Let's Encrypt has helped, they're a lot further customers that'll allow us to use let's encrypt for for free certs, and even then there's still 100 limit. Let's Encrypt does have new wild-card certs but it's the same we have to get domain authorization approval and universities many we're not willing to do that so those don't help us that much.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Brian:</strong> Right, the number of people who have to sign off on things like wild-card certs are... It gets to be a little bit of a process.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Ronnie:</strong> Which I understand the need for, right, but when we're also trying to protect your sites it's a it's a challenge it's a balancing act to kind of figure out. So those sorts of pain points technically you know at scale are the types of problems that we've had to figure out. And we're still improving, still working on.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">Other things with multisite that's kind of unique to multisite issues to think about with hosting and scale are, you know, our typical dev-test-prod environments at large multisite networks, that's a much bigger challenge. You know, most of your managed host solutions out there, or all options that you have out there for quickly cloning a site putting it in a development environment just fail they break at scale. And so, if anybody comes up with a really good solution for large multisites you know, we should chat!</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">But the things that we've kind of done to go to get around that, I think, there's there's cloning plugins, we have one. There are some free cloning plugins that you can clone individual sites so, we use that kind of for testing and development environments and then moving into production. So you can take an existing and live site on your live multisite network, clone it to a new site, like a new URL, make it private maybe on the site, change your themes, change your content, activate the plugins whatever you want to do and test it. And then you can clone it back over the live site when you're ready.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">So that's kind of a workflow that most of our customers are pretty happy with when it comes to an individual site on the multisite network. And then for testing you just provide an identical production environment at like a development URL. You can't really sync the content, or I mean you can but it's time consuming, and kind of you know after you do so the contents not synced anymore. So we sync it occasionally, make sure that the settings are same and that's where we can test you know network wide settings changes or a new network plug-in or theme or something that we want to add. But those types of things are different than maybe a small multisite, or a single WordPress install and it's often kind of confusing and a, something developers that are used to that, it's been drilled in all of us, this test-dev-prod you know environment to not offer that is something to kind of talk through the reasons why and make sure that we're happy with alternatives around it.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Brian:</strong> Absolutely. So I just want to wrap up with one last question for you. This has all been really useful for I think, I've been watching Jen take notes as we figure out how to maintain our sites. This is all been really useful and interesting for us.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Jen:</strong> We didn't even get to the question give me all the good plugins. Just send me that list of approved plugins. But I'll just catch you at WPCampus and be like come on give it give it up.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Ronnie:</strong> Absolutely, and it is in our doc section on CampusPress.com/docs/plugins has all of our approved plugins. So many are ours are from WPMU Dev but many are also not that we've kind of vetted and approved that's beyond. And I'm not I'm not gonna lie we stock the, like WordPress VIP plug-in list and pull from there when we can and things like that so it's a good thing.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Brian:</strong> So you've been, CampusPress has been involved with WPCampus basically from the start. You were a sponsor at the first event in Sarasota. What makes WPCampus so valuable for CampusPress?</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Ronnie:</strong> I think for our entire team, it's the only, or the best kind of professional development that we can have internally. So you know the conversations that we can have, the lurking and the Slack channels, being at the conference and attending the the sessions for for our whole team, we can't can't get anything better, you know, the folks that are using WordPress on the front lines. That's who we need to learn from and know how we can only make that experience better for them. So I mean it's completely a big part of what we do. All, almost all of our team from the support sales down to the developers, you know, they lurk in Slack and watch the online sessions and things like that so it's huge for us.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Jen:</strong> I'm gonna add on to that, what are you most looking forward to at this year's conference?</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Ronnie:</strong> Oh you know I haven't checked the schedule completely yet, in terms of sessions and things like that. But I feel like every year there's a little bit of a, kind of a focus on what we're talking about, and I could be totally wrong but I kind of get the feeling that we're talking more about content and use of different ways of generating and sharing and using content and that's kind of a focus of mine too.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">So come any conversations or sessions around new and interesting ways of anything to do with content is good for me because I feel like in general this is outside of higher ed, marketing and things like that we have content overload, social media exhaustion, I could go on and on about this stuff and lost in the noise and, so, I want to know what folks are doing to combat that.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Jen:</strong> Do you think Gutenberg will help with that because it will accidentally delete all of our content as we transition?</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Ronnie:</strong> Yes it's definitely going to on-purpose delete it. That's a that's a feature, not a bug. You know and I think that Gutenberg will help. We can make more interesting content, more interesting looking content I should say. I might have some skepticism on people really wanting to make every single post look beautiful because we do that on some of our internal company blogs and it is a lot of work and it takes more than one it takes up more than one person. Iit takes it takes a designer who's not a content expert whoever's writing the content it takes collaboration there.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Jen:</strong> And design is something everybody thinks that they have but very few do.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Ronnie:</strong> Yeah I mean I know that I'm the worst designer in our hundred-person company by far but it's a bit up but I'll still try. That's the problem! I'll have a tool that will help me try more. So I don’t know.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">But anything around content, I’ll try to answer that question a little bit there. I'm curious as to the direction that's going because good old-fashioned content marketing, hoping that people find you through Google it is just not working anymore I think for universities as well.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Brian:</strong> Well, thanks so much for talking with us. I'm just gonna read a few things before we wrap up. If you have something else you want to say as I read it feel free to jump in this is a not a very formal podcast.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">So we mentioned this just a moment ago, WPCampus 2018 will be July 12th through the 14th at the campus of Washington University in St. Louis! In addition to the 34 talks and a wide variety of topics, this year's conference will include workshops on Gutenberg, content strategy, and web governance. And then there are also going to be some games running through the conference. This is a little something to mix it up a little bit that I've been working with Rachel on to encourage some good conference behavior, get more session feedback, and hopefully have a little bit of fun, too.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Jen:</strong> We should get Rachel it'll let us drop some hints about trivia questions in here.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Brian:</strong> You can learn more about the conference and everything that we've got planned for it at 2018.dev5290.wpcampus.org.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">Just as a reminder, you can subscribe to this podcast on iTunes and on Google Play by searching for WPCampus Podcast, and you can listen to each episode and follow links to more information at dev5290.wpcampus.org/podcast.

One of those reasons: the European Union will be implementing the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, this spring. GDPR has global implications, which means there are changes coming to WordPress core, and also to how we build themes and plugins.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">My name is Brian DeConinck, and I work for North Carolina State University. I&#8217;m joined today by Heather Burns, a digital law and policy specialist. You can learn about Heather&#8217;s work at her website, webdevlaw.uk. Among her many projects, she is part of the team working to prepare WordPress core for GDPR. She joins us to talk about upcoming changes to WordPress, and privacy best practices for site admins and plugin authors.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">One quick note before we hear that conversation: Our recording picked up a little more background noise than usual this time. I&#8217;ve cleaned things up, so most of the conversation is pretty clear, but if there&#8217;s anything you couldn&#8217;t make out, you can visit dev5290.wpcampus.org/podcast for a full transcript.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">Transcribing the podcast is something I&#8217;ve been wanting to do for a long time for accessibility reasons, so I&#8217;m glad there were some loud voices in the background this time that gave me the push to finally do it.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">With all of that out of the way, here&#8217;s Heather!</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Heather:</strong> Thank you for inviting me on, Brian!</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Brian:</strong> Well, thank you so much for being on!</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">So, just hypothetically, if there&#8217;s someone who&#8217;s listening who has no idea what GDPR is, or anything at all related to it, what is GDPR?</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Heather:</strong> So GDPR is a renewal and a refresh of the European data protection and privacy structure. Very different from the way the United States works, in Europe we have a single overarching data protection framework, across all situations, all sectors, all business sizes, whether you&#8217;re the largest corporation or a one-woman business, or for that matter a university, the same set of laws apply to you.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">We&#8217;ve been working with a European data protection framework since 1995, so what GDPR is, as I&#8217;ve said, it&#8217;s a renewal and a refresh of those rules, which was, you know, desperately out of date.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">So, we&#8217;re all getting ready for it here. It may seem a little bit cumbersome, but it is ultimately such a healthy business process to go through, because everyone needs to go back to basics and examine how they collect data, what they collect data about, why they collect it. And I find the compliance journey is actually so rewarding. It allows them to feel better in control and empowered of the ways they do business with data.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Brian:</strong> I feel like, in recent years especially, data storage is cheap, so we&#8217;ve all sort of gotten addicted to the idea that we can just keep things forever and ever and ever, but GDPR seems like it&#8217;s going to force sort of a cultural shift.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Heather:</strong> It will. And, not before time. I&#8217;ve been speaking and writing about this stuff for years, but even in the past month all of the news stories really got people just thinking about these things. Developers, how the decisions they make can create a snowball which avalanches into a privacy concern. So, now&#8217;s the right time to be thinking about it.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Brian:</strong> GDPR is a European Union regulation. Many, I would say most people who are involved with WPCampus are not in the European Union, although we have people around the world. But GDPR does apply globally to anyone who&#8217;s interacting with people in the EU. So can you tell us a little bit about the scope of GDPR and who&#8217;s covered by it?</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Heather:</strong> Well, European data protection law has always been extra-territorial. It has always applied to people within the European Union regardless of where their data was collected and processed. But because the existing data protection framework was from, again, 1995, floppy disks and dial-up, the constant international data flows we deal with all the time, whether that&#8217;s a client&#8217;s business records or the data syncing to cloud storage on your phone, wasn&#8217;t really adequately addressed until now.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">So, GDPR applies to any business, organization, or educational institution which is collecting or processing data about European Union residents, regardless of their nationality or location within Europe. If you serve customers in the European Union and you&#8217;re an American business, you still have to protect their data to European standards. And that also applies to educational institutions, whether it&#8217;s students, prospective students, alumni. I think we&#8217;re going to dive a little more into that today.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Brian:</strong> Yeah, well, I&#8217;m thinking about my own university. I work for North Carolina State, and we have online education programs, we have international students, we have a satellite campus in Prague, all these different ways that we&#8217;re interacting with people in Europe, that on a day-to-day basis I might not even be thinking about, let alone just people who might show up and sign up for a newsletter on a website, or something like that.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">So, higher ed, at least in my experience, we don&#8217;t always take change very well. And in many ways this is a big change. It&#8217;s going to require us to re-think how our websites function and how we interact with our users.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">Looking at WordPress core specifically, what kinds of interactions are we really concerned about, just in the core WordPress application?</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Heather:</strong> Getting ready for GDPR has posed a few unique challenges to the WordPress ecosystem. When it comes to privacy, core, all things considered, is pretty good. There are a couple of tweaks and changes and improvements we&#8217;re making that we&#8217;re going to discuss later. But the challenge for WordPress is that a WordPress site is a combination of core, and plugins, and themes. And there are infinite combinations of ways that those aggregated websites collect data, process data, the way the website administrators use the data, access the data, or not.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">So, our challenge was to, not to&#8212;let&#8217;s be honest, we cannot make any WordPress site compliant with anything, but what we can do is fix what is humanly possible to fix, and then provide site administrators with the tools and resources they need to make the right decisions and to inform their site users about the best ways to protect and safeguard their data.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Brian:</strong> So this isn&#8217;t something&#8212;I&#8217;ve seen you talk about this in Slack and also the recent change to the published WordPress plugin standards, that you can&#8217;t just have a plugin that makes you GDPR complaint, that solves all of your problems magically for you.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Heather:</strong> I like to tell people there&#8217;s actually no such thing as GDPR compliance, because it&#8217;s a bit like saying you&#8217;re healthy. Just because you&#8217;re healthy today, doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re going to be healthy in a week. It&#8217;s about your ongoing, every day business processes, the ways you do business, how you take data, how you store data, and the quickest way to let your standard slip is to ever believe that you are compliant.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">So the notion of, just install a plugin that will do all that stuff for you is something I&#8217;ve been railing against on WordPress pages for years. So we took the opportunity to have the plugin guidelines amended so that no one could ever say that their plugin would make the site legally compliant in anything, whether that&#8217;s GDPR or ADA or, I&#8217;ve even been seeing plugins that offer to spit out a legally water-tight business contract.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">There are many things that we&#8217;ve been able to take a look at, not necessarily within the very narrow definition of the GDPR compliance deadline, but which have an equally important impact, and certainly be relevant for future work after this deadline.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Brian:</strong> I want to talk a little about that future work in a minute, but let&#8217;s, I guess, dig into some specifics. I&#8217;m a plugin developer and I&#8217;m a site administrator. We all interact with WordPress in lots of different ways. What are some of the specific changes we can expect to see in WordPress core?</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Heather:</strong> Well, I&#8217;ve been working [inaudible] late January, early February, with a core compliance project group, which is Automatticians, plugin developers, volunteers, just anyone who&#8217;s interested in these issues of how do we get WordPress for GDPR? Keeping in mind that, as I said, we can&#8217;t make a website compliant. So what can we do to help administrators get there?</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">The GDPR compliance project has four areas that we&#8217;re working on. First is developing tools for core for the various requirements of GDPR, such as data export, being able to delete a user&#8217;s information.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">The second thing we&#8217;re working on is a tool to create a GDPR-compliant privacy policy, because&#8212;and I just gave a whole talk about this on Sunday at WordCamp London&#8212;privacy notices are a big part of helping be GDPR compliant, and the days of these legalese gibberish walls of text are over. Privacy policies now have to be open, transparent, helpful dialogues with the user, of the ways you&#8217;re using their data and what options they have over it.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">So that, again, creates a challenge for when you might have a site with thirty plugins and themes and contact forms and such there. So we&#8217;re developing a tool that will help site administrators develop that privacy policy without having to talk to lawyers or developers.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">Third area we&#8217;re working on is, we&#8217;re going to take a look at the plugin development guidelines, because any work we might be doing now can only be retroactively applied to existing plugins. If plugins have areas they could be slightly better in, regarding privacy and data protection, it&#8217;s because we haven&#8217;t clarified that sufficiently enough. So we&#8217;re going to better define what is now acceptable, for best privacy and data protection practices. Again, not within the strict definition of GDPR, as a European law, but as privacy as a general principle.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">And the fourth area we&#8217;re looking at, is more developing information resources for site administrators, everyday site users, and developers on what they need to know about GDPR, as well as general best practices and privacy and data protection, in language geared toward each of those audiences.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">So, this work, fingers crossed, with lots of coffee and Red Bull, will all be ready and up and running by the 25th of May, which is the day GDPR becomes enforceable in Europe.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">We&#8217;re also noting things we could equally turn our attention to, but kind of putting them on the B-list until we&#8217;re done with this specific deadline. And then we&#8217;re going to take a breather and come back to them afterwards.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Brian:</strong> And so, by May 25th, that would also be, I guess, WordPress version 4.9.6, maybe?</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Heather:</strong> Possibly? Yeah. I&#8217;ve heard things about 5, but, you know what deadlines are like, so.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Brian:</strong> I&#8217;ve been sort of lurking in the GDPR compliance channel in WordPress Slack for a couple weeks, just trying to get myself up to speed for what I need to know. I&#8217;m seeing some tools that will hopefully be available for data review and data export for end users. Can you talk a little about what those kinds of tools might look like, bearing in mind they&#8217;re not actually real yet, they&#8217;re still in development?</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Heather:</strong> Well, you&#8217;re welcome to help us test them!</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">On data export, users have the right to export all the data that a site holds on them. You&#8217;ve heard the apocryphal stories of people requesting that Facebook send them a copy of their data, and they literally get the box, the ream of paper, [inaudible] the entire box. So, we&#8217;re looking for ways, again, to number one, create a tool that will allow the user to request the data export, to verify the identity so it&#8217;s not someone trying to steal your data, and for the site administrator to provide a copy of it.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">And also looking at building the functionality into those tools so that it also pulls the required data from your plugins.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">If you think about it, this has been a really difficult, but good challenge to get our teeth into. How do we create functionality to pull all of this information the user or the administrator will need from very diverse plugins doing very different things?</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">So we have an export tool. The privacy notice tool is something that really excites me. It will&#8212;again, coffee and Red Bull willing&#8212;allow users to generate a GDPR-compliant privacy notice in a page that would be a default. When you install a new site, you have &#8220;Hello&#8221; and &#8220;About&#8221; pages, and you&#8217;re going to have a privacy notice page now.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">That page will generate the information, but it will not publish it. There will be plugins that choose not to comply and don&#8217;t provide the information. There will be information that the business owner or the site administrator is required to provide in any case, you cannot automate this process. You have to be accountable, there are questions only you can answer.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">So we&#8217;re providing the tool that will let them get halfway, provide the information they have to get on their own accord, and then able to review that and manually publish it. So, we&#8217;re not going to do the job for them, we&#8217;re not going to do your homework for you. We&#8217;re going to give you the tools you need to do it right, but it&#8217;s still ultimately the administrator&#8217;s responsibility to ensure the accuracy of that notice and then to publish it.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Brian:</strong> And I guess it also raises the standard&#8212;responsible WordPress admins have had to do their due diligence in reviewing security and things like that in the plugins that they&#8217;re adding, but now it&#8217;s just another thing that we need to be thinking about.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Heather:</strong> Absolutely.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Brian:</strong> So, thinking about higher ed, a lot of large universities, especially in the United States, are addicted to decentralization. We don&#8217;t always like talking to ourselves, and we don&#8217;t always like talking about important things before deadlines.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">Thinking about my own university for instance, we have, across twelve colleges in the university we have thousands of WordPress websites. Some of them are in multisite, some of them aren&#8217;t. Some of them are maintained actively by IT staff, some of them were created and somebody walked away from them. And this is just sort of an ongoing challenge for our own processes, and maintaining security, and things like that. But thinking about GDPR and privacy in general, coordinating privacy policies with our legal office and vetting plugins, seems like a large task.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">So, with that in mind, can you solve all of my problems for me? What kind of recommendations would you give for prioritizing and assessing risk when you&#8217;re trying to decide what to do and how to approach GDPR for one website, or many websites?</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Heather:</strong> The first and most important thing is it needs to be a cross-disciplinary effort. GDPR is about removing the notion that privacy is a contractual matter for lawyers. In fact, they&#8217;re the last people who should be involved. It needs to be cross-disciplinary across your management, across marketing, across design and UX, across administration, and, yes, across legal, although I don&#8217;t honestly expect an American university lawyer to understand much about European privacy law.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">But, the expression that I&#8217;ve used in all the speaking I&#8217;ve done about GDPR is &#8220;pull your socks up.&#8221; GDPR is about pulling your socks up. All the little processes we&#8217;ve gotten sloppy and lazy about. And maybe, UX didn&#8217;t design something a certain way beause marketing didn&#8217;t tell them, or admin didn&#8217;t tell them that they were collecting [inaudible].</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">So the healthiest way to start the GDPR compliance process is to literally get everyone in a room around a table and ask these questions. What information do we collect? Where do we collect it? Why do we collect it? Who has access to it? Where do we store it? For how long do we store it? What rights do people have over it?</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">It includes everything from paper files to archives to backups to old files in registrars, to alumni donor information. And this is why, as I said at the beginning, this can be such a powerful process. Very few organizations will ever have sat down and asked these questions to begin with. And you will be staggered when you just face the scope of what you have, where you have it, and who has access to it.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">And then you start by looking at your risks. A very healthy process to do as part of the privacy by design framework, which is part of GDPR&#8217;s requirements for data-intensive projects, is the impact assessment. And that&#8217;s a living written document that everyone involved in the project signs off on, where you ask those questions that I just posed, and you take it a little deeper and talk about the risks.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">What are the risks to us holding this data? What are the risks to the users? What are the risks to the organization, in this case the university? What happens if this data is leaked? What happens if it is breached? What happens if it is misused? And what risk mitigation strategies are we going to put in to make sure that that doesn&#8217;t happen?</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">So your first step might be deleting a heck of a lot of data. I love how GDPR is causing this big global data purge, of stuff you don&#8217;t need or shouldn&#8217;t have been asking for in the first place.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Brian:</strong> Right. I don&#8217;t necessarily need IP addresses from people who visited my website three years ago, that I&#8217;m not doing anything with, that I&#8217;m not looking for any useful information from it.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Heather:</strong> A healthy part of compliance is creating a data minimization, retention, and deletion schedule, for every kind of data you hold. GDPR doesn&#8217;t set hard and fast rules on these things, but it expects you to come up with a rationale for how long you&#8217;re keeping all this data, why you&#8217;re keeping it, and when you&#8217;re deleting it, for every bit of data that you hold.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">So it may be that we keep all alumni data forever and ever, and as long as you can justify it, that&#8217;s fine. It may be prospective clients and applicants, you&#8217;re not going to need their data after two years, because even if they were coming back and going to you anyway, they&#8217;d have to start a whole new process, so why are you keeping all of that data? For network administrators, site logs, site admin things, there are certain legal obligations you may have to comply with about how long you keep visitor data in case there&#8217;s a court case or misuse of a university system.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">That&#8217;s fine. But think about everything you&#8217;re keeping and how long you&#8217;re keeping it, and come up with a regular schedule for deletion. And that way, you have so much less data that could be misused.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Brian:</strong> In some respects, I feel like higher education institutions are better poised to think about this than private businesses, just because, at least in the United States, there are already many laws surrounding student data, for instance, how that&#8217;s retained and who&#8217;s allowed to have access to it. This is just sort of a broadening of that scope, it&#8217;s not just students that we&#8217;re thinking about, it&#8217;s everybody who&#8217;s interacting in some form with the university.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Heather:</strong> I mean, I remember, I was an undergraduate in the States over twenty years ago, and my student identification number was my Social Security number. And it was on your library card, it was on your ID card, when it was exam time they would just post the Excel spreadsheet outside the university department with your results by your Social Security number.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Brian:</strong> In hindsight, that wasn&#8217;t such a great idea.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Heather:</strong> You know, it&#8217;s amazing how far we&#8217;ve come in twenty years, but we had a very far way to come.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">So it&#8217;s true that US law has sectoral regulations on privacy pertaining to students, but there is a culturual difference between the United States and here. And I&#8217;m not trying to paint anybody right or wrong, better or worse, I&#8217;m just explaining the difference. The US culture of privacy is, you&#8217;re opted in and you have to opt out. Whereas the European approach is, you are opted out and you have to opt in.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">So the US approach is, collect all the data, keep the data, and then if you&#8217;re going to do something with it later, maybe only then think about it. Whereas, the European approach forces you to pass a lot of hurdles before you are ever collecting that data in the first place.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">So, even though your American university data will be pretty tightly protected, it&#8217;s still a really good opportunity to look at it through minimization retention eyes and see things like user rights over the data. The European view is, again, where it&#8217;s user-centric, whereas the American view is, it&#8217;s institution-centric.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">So think in terms about how, what if the user just doesn&#8217;t want this data collected? What if they don&#8217;t want the alumni office calling them until the day they die asking for money? That sort of thing.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Brian:</strong> I think perhaps our alumni office has a different view of that interaction. But yeah, this is an opportunity to rethink how we approach the people who interact with our institution.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Heather:</strong> Absolutely.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Brian:</strong> Going back to, I guess the mechanics of GDPR for a moment, it&#8217;ll be fully implemented on May 25th. Do we have a sense for what a GDPR complaint might look like for an organization or an institution that&#8217;s not compliant? What kind of a process might be followed? I assume this is where lawyers get involved.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Heather:</strong> Actually, no. It&#8217;s a big misconception, because&#8212;We have a process in Europe where we work through data protection regulators, we have something like that here. Every nation has a regulator. The closest you come in the US is the FCC, but not really, it&#8217;s kind of sort of, but not really.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">So if an alumni living in Scotland has a problem with being harassed by her alma mater in Washington and realizes, &#8220;they&#8217;re also selling my data and I&#8217;m getting junk mail?&#8221; what she has the right to do is contact her national data protection authority, and say they&#8217;re not respecting us. And that data protection authority will get in touch with the institution in the United States and explain they&#8217;re concerned that you are not respecting our citizens&#8217; data. Could you explain your processes and procedures?</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">So, it is a cooperative process. They will work with you. Sometimes Americans don&#8217;t seem to understand that the European privacy system, it&#8217;s not about courtrooms and lawyers. I&#8217;ve seen comments on posts I&#8217;ve written, things like &#8220;Will I be prosecuted?&#8221; That&#8217;s not how it works, it&#8217;s not an adversarial, it&#8217;s not criminal law. It&#8217;s civil statute. It&#8217;s done through cooperative involvement with regulators.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">The only reason you&#8217;re ever going to get a fine, and there&#8217;s so much rubbish and misinformation and scare-mongering about fines&#8212;fines, certainly in the UK where I am, are only ever levied as the fourth stage of an exhaustive process where they have genuinely tried to work with you, and you&#8217;ve not taken their advice or you&#8217;ve repeated mistakes. Or, it&#8217;s levied in cases of truly egregious data breaches, where the fine was absolutely justified, so your Facebooks and your Ubers.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">But the regulator will work with you. However, you have to meet her half way. And if the regulator comes to you and says, &#8220;We&#8217;re really concerned, you&#8217;re actually selling data about thousands of your alumni over here to marketers without their consent, could you please show us what opt-in consent they gave to that?&#8221; And if your answer to that is, &#8220;Uhhh&#8230;&#8221; you have two problems. Because the fact that someone attended your university twenty years ago was not granting active consent for every list you want to put them on until the day they die.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">So, again, you&#8217;ve got to start thinking about these processes now. Where did we get this data from? Why is this person on this list? What rights do we give this person? And that&#8217;s healthy, I think.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Brian:</strong> Yeah, I think it&#8217;s going to force us to think about things we get away with not thinking about a lot of the time.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">So, we&#8217;ve talked a little about the changes that&#8212;again, coffee and Red Bull&#8212;coming soon to WordPress. But this is the first major push for privacy anything in the WordPress community that I can remember. What comes next? What comes after May 25th? What&#8217;s the future of privacy in WordPress, and giving more tools, giving more recommendations to WordPress users?</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Heather:</strong> Well, this is only my personal view, but my personal view is I would like to see privacy become a core team, like accessibility. You may remember, a few years ago, accessibility had to fight for their voice to be heard. And now, they are an active core team. So I would love to see a privacy core team to look at these issues going forward.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">There&#8217;s so much we could look at and learn from, we just have to keep cranking towards a specific deadline or a specific piece of legislation. So I think it&#8217;s a really big challenge that we should be sinking our teeth into, about how do we create a best standard and practices for privacy and user protection, not pinned to any one particular legal framework. But mindful of the fact that there are elements we can cherry-pick from various different legislation and systems, to create a really good best practice standard for all developers to use.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Brian:</strong> Do you find, in&#8212;so, I&#8217;m going to pontificate for a moment. What I&#8217;ve observed, as somebody following along with core development is, there&#8217;s a lot of enthusiasm for building something new like Gutenberg, but core teams like accessibility, while they do have that recognition, there&#8217;s a lot less activity in those channels in Slack, there&#8217;s a lot less activity just in general.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">Do you find that, the interests of the people who are contributing to an open source project, they often tend toward, I want to write code. I want to build something new. How do you balance that with these sort of big questions that WordPress needs to grapple with, and make sure that they do get the time and get the attention and get the interest that they need to get?</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Heather:</strong> Well, I&#8217;ve been in the community for ten years, and it&#8217;s been my observation that&#8212;and this is a personal observation, but anyone is welcome to disagree with me&#8212;but I feel that the reason accessibility and privacy have been so hard to sell is because they&#8217;re intrinsically connected to law and legal frameworks.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">And there&#8217;s a lot of people in the community who see anything connected to law and run the other way. They think it&#8217;s the preserve of lawyers, they think that they will be held responsible for any mistakes they made, they think that maybe because they&#8217;re not legally qualified they shouldn&#8217;t be working on this.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">But, certainly with GDPR, lawyers really do not need to get involved. It&#8217;s a development framework. Where you need lawyers is to do things like sign off on things like your contracts with third-party providers.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">But it would be helpful for us as a community to get over our stigma of anything legal. And thinking of it, again not trying to cause a cultural fight, but thinking of it as a judge, and a gavel, and a courtroom, and a lawyer talking a load of rubbish. It&#8217;s a completely separate kind of law from the law that we&#8217;re talking about, in terms of making sites disability compliant, making sites privacy compliant.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">So if we just approach them with a little more bravery, less fear. And, through all of our enthusiasm towards creating tools and writing code, as we&#8217;re doing now with the GDPR compliance project, we have a responsibility, as the makers of the tools that create 30 percent of the web, to do better by all of our users. And we could truly make the web a better place for the 30 percent who use it, who use our product, by approaching legal compliance with less trepidation, more confidence.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Brian:</strong> Heather, this has been a really great conversation for me, just my own peace of mind, understanding what&#8217;s happening with GDPR. I think a lot of people are going to find it very useful.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">Do you have any favorite resources you&#8217;d like to point people towards? I guess your WordCamp London talk on privacy statements.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Heather:</strong> I did, I did that on Sunday, and the video will be up at some point on WordPress TV. I&#8217;ve done a couple of other WordCamp talks on GDPR, and I&#8217;ve also recently written some Smashing Magazine articles on the privacy by design framework and how GDPR will change you as a developer. And you&#8217;ve just reminded me, I owe them another article I should probably start.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">So I will pass you the links for those, and you can put them in the show notes, Brian.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Brian:</strong> That sounds great. And if someone wants to follow you online, on Twitter you&#8217;re @&#8212;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Heather:</strong> @webdevlaw.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Brian:</strong> And that&#8217;s also your username in the WordPress Slack community. It&#8217;s been very interesting for me following along with the GDPR compliance channel, and I&#8217;m really looking forward to seeing what comes in the next couple of weeks.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Heather:</strong> I&#8217;ll just add that if you&#8217;re coming to WordCamp Europe, I&#8217;ll be teaching a three-hour workshop on developing for GDPR and privacy and data protection. So if you go to the WordCamp Europe website, you have to register for it just for headcount purposes, but I would love to see you there!</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Brian:</strong> Sounds great!</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Heather:</strong> I can&#8217;t wait to show the world what we&#8217;ve done. Thank you for having me on, Brian!</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Brian:</strong> Thank you so much!</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">As we finish up, I&#8217;ll just read a few notes and then we&#8217;ll be all done.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">If any listeners haven&#8217;t already done this, mark your calendars for WPCampus 2018.
